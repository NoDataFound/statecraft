@His first comments were ceasefires don‚Äôt work. WWIII then? Ukraine is running out of soldiers. That‚Äôs a fact. The next move is for other countries to join in and then it‚Äôs all out war.
Trump only wants rare earth in payback for what Biden GAVE plus more and doesnt want to help Ukraine anymore whilst still taking half of rare earth whilst Eu troops on ground helping keep peace and US do nothing and make deals with Russia, your as bad as trump if you think your the one hard done by...Idiot. @@Joyreidisaracissssssss
Amazing content as always!
Ukrainian Latvianian polish Belarus and Jew what they did to the country holders as a Jew are the refugees not there land
now instead of the US making weapons we can make money manufacturing security arms. The US government pays people to manufacture war weapons, it&#39;s a huge biz...there will never be peace as long as so many people are profiting off war. We do need peace keeping mechanisms in place until the megalomaniacs are gone. not holding my breath - sorry.
Is this a misunderstanding or malicious intent: Demand a ceasefire not to the aggressor but to the victim?
Settled whatever poor Zelenskyi say Trump and Vance had to make him crazy, greedy, disrespectful. Nothing from this are true, I think Trump and Vance actually acted disrespectful and not fair, what if your country get attacked and someone like Trump say ;end this war because there are people dying; no matter that you country get attacked you have to accept peace deal and give your territory to attacker and sing some deal which guarantee you nothing? Trump is maybe better president than Biden in peaceful time but now he fall this exam.
pathetic circus made for and by wimps! shame on you!
does JD have a brain!?!?!??!?!?
Zelensky looks confused and like he is on drugs.
@ I‚Äôm not American nor am I very up-to-date on political issues, so my (humble) comment is purely about their demeanour from what I could see here‚Ä¶ It seems a bit baffling to me that the two people leading the world‚Äôs superpower are this short-tempered. And, especially since Zelenskyy put out a statement thanking them after this, my heart aches at what is seemingly his willingness to be humiliated (and, frankly, to kiss their asses) in order to get much needed help for his people and country. Again, I‚Äôm a cocooned 22-year-old, but am very saddened that, to me, it seemed like not once did Trump and Vance‚Äôs comments seem to be out of genuine care for putting an end to a horrific war, but, instead, rage the moment they were confronted with a truth about their indifference about it‚Ä¶(Sorry, I‚Äôm resending this comment as I think I replied to myself the first time!)
Zelenskz showing his best side again i want we need you have and arrogance !
The irony of Vance churping up about diplomacy whilst destroying that attempted diplomacy is funny but also not really because these jokers ate in power.
59 german soldiers died, when the US was adventuring in Afghanistan. 250.000 afghan refugees are cared for by Germany, as a direct consequence of that war. Maybe its time, we send the USA the bill for that, too.
DT sounded kinda of like a leader  until he bashed Biden, lied again about the amount of money Europe gave and he gloated about himself. And He did Thank him before this meeting. Than Vance had to add his 2 cents.

@ I heard everything‚ÄîZelensky refuted Vance by citing historical facts that demonstrate Putin‚Äôs dishonesty.
Ukraine was a fanatic ally of the Nazis and enemy of America during BOTH world wars! We must stop Ukraine from dragging us into &amp; instigating world war 3! Anyone who supports Ukraine is ignorant of Russian affairs and Eastern European history and history more generally.
Zelenskyy is an entitled dictator who thinks he can run roughshod over our current President and Vice President. News Flash Zelenskyy - the inept Biden administration no longer exists. You are now dealing with REAL leaders who are not afraid to say the hard things.
good meeting. truly we needed to see this!
Nothing much to say but JD vance you should learn how to speak you were talking to a president my man for me zelensky wasnt given enough chance to speak üò¢
strange meeting between the President and a team of inadequate traders who accidentally got power
Zelensky did a mistake not speaking through an interpreter as he clearly isn&#39;t in great command of the english language and I think both the president and JD may have misunderstood what he really wanted to say because of it.
One thing is for sure... somebody caught them eye rolls
what is JD talking about ‚Ä¶ Zelensky did nothing but thank the president throughout the entire conversation he said god bless he said thank you he said hopefully the president will be able to stop it? he was respectful the entire time. then JD pulled out some authoritarian behavior and tried to condemn him like he was a three year old?
NO AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE WILL EVER PERSUADE AN IDIOT AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONCERNING THAN CONSENSUS IGNORANCE AND WILLFUL STUPIDITY, trump AND vance ARE A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THAT IGNORANCE
Vance is such a tool. All  volodymyr zelensky was saying he doesn&#39;t trust another deal with Putin and Vance took it somewhere completely different. Talking about saying thank you. He needs to sit back and let the big boys talk.
Who is the idiot that is alway clapping and laughing ! On the back ground.

Does anyone love the sound of their own voice more than Vance?
Thank you for posting this. It is important to see the whole thing before you pass judgement. For me the whole thing started around 16 mins in where a serious question is posed starting with, ;I just wanted to ask both of you.....; Trump responds, but when Zelensky goes to answer he&#39;s cut off (around 17.20). Trump then carries on with an obviously planted question and goes on to do what Trump does. He talks about himself magnificently!Thankfully Zelensky get a question all of his own. You can see he wants to answer the previous, important question, but no.....;Why don&#39;t you wear a suit?; I think this is the moment where he thinks no one is taking him seriously. Add to that the fatigue of war, travel and he is having to translate everything or have it translated. This puts you on the back foot constantly and is very draining. Had this been the first question (always start a show lighthearted) he could have answered what most of us know. He wears it in solidarity of his troops. The timing and delivery of the question prompts his (maybe) less than cordial, but humorous response. I do believe Trump will do what he says. Like him or loath him, he is the only &#39;politician&#39; that has ever delivered on a promise. I&#39;m sure the Mexicans are elated with their new body of water! He has divided opinion, but could make Europe great again. It is also evident that he is better at talking than listening. By the time it got to the guy wearing eye liner and brown lipstick (quite rightly) bringing up trying to solve the war with diplomacy Zelensky was too far gone. JD Sports started well, veered off into telling Zelensky how he should act, then came the churlish, ;did you say thank you...?; Later Zelensky is accused of telling them how they should feel, which is completely misinterperated, by Trump. Zelensky&#39;s English isn&#39;t great, but you get the gist of what he means which he then tries to clarify under Trumps tirade. He meant that the US would feel the impact if Putin is allowed to run rampant.Zelensky should have played it cooler however (easy for me to say) and he should know when to keep quiet. He&#39;s too close to it, but it was important for him to be seen with Trump. Evidently the Americans didn&#39;t like Zelenskys free speech, which as they say in the conference is very important to them. Trump was Trump. One day calling someone a dictator then next denying all knowledge of it (a ploy?). Through the self aggrandisation and Trump Trivia (or Fart Facts in Scotland) what he says makes sense. He can&#39;t disrespect Putin if he has to negotiate. Then again he can&#39;t hail Putin as a victim in front of a victim. Another trigger for Zelensky. JD Sports? The worst kind of slimy wannabe bully who fires his verbal catapult while hiding behind the big kid! A clever idiot.....in a suit!It seems like they did the press conference before the actual meeting and agreement which I think was a mistake. This should all have taken place behind closed doors. Facinating and frightening to see behind the scenes diplomacy in action in front of the worlds press! Staged? Trump is a showman, Zelensky an actor and JD Sports a proctologists dream. It was certainly great TV!If there is to be a next time, they all need to remember who they are dealing with and where they are. ...and no. Zelensky doesn&#39;t need to wear a suit!
No. No. You know what‚Äôs fkn ‚Äúdisgusting,‚Äù Trump, you and Vance who‚Äôve never been in a war and yet here you both are turning the fkn tide ON A MAN IN WAR who handled himself way fkn better THAN YOU.

Loved this video, keep up the great work!
the irony of trump voters saying this while having their welfare checks subsidized by the blue states.
Why is it that nobody brings up the coup in 2014, that put this clown in power, and the fact that they made laws against their own citizens based on race and language/ heritage, and the fact that they were bombing their own citizens for 8 years before Russia put a stop to it.   And the fact that Ukraine is full of nazis.  Then let&#39;s talk about Ukraine not only selling most of the weapons and military equipment that was shipped over there, but also the untold millions that went missing as well.  Let&#39;s talk about facts.  The only security guarantee they need is one that protects all citizens in Ukraine, not just the ethnic German descendants.
All he did was raise a few valid concerns. Am I missing something?
If he had worn a suit, they would have said to him, ;Why are you wearing a suit? You&#39;re at war. Your world is dying. You&#39;ve come as a groom.; That was pure diplomacy. You shouldn&#39;t have made such a big deal out of it, and I&#39;m surprised it got so many likes. Also, no one but Trump should have spoken to him like that. Although we think the most correct of the three is Putin, and then Trump.But on the same time Amrica is lucky to have Trump, let the man do the work.

Soytarƒ±,katil ve hƒ±rsƒ±z amerika.
1- his attitude changed when the Polish reporter brought up that irrational trigger about the USSR times, which it‚Äôs a bit irrational at this point. I get it when it‚Äôs someone in the pub, but you can‚Äôt be that emotional when you‚Äôre a freaking president. He had been nodding for almost an hour and then triggered like a bipolar person. and 2- before the s*** hit the fan, he called the VP ‚Äúsuka‚Äù (the B word) on TV in the White House.
I don‚Äôt think you were paying attention. The US wants a ceasefire, and Zelensky went in there under that understanding. He then says repeatedly from the beginning that a ceasefire won‚Äôt work. Vance had to say something because Putin was watching. He had to say that this was only going to work with diplomacy, because Zelenskyy was acting like we‚Äôre going to help him win the war and that can‚Äôt happen without WW3.

respect zelensky
JD almost train wreaked that meeting
It‚Äôs hard, English is Zelensky‚Äôs second language and Trump doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to speak it clearly at all.
People totally ignoring how contentious and undermining Zelensky was throughout the interview.
Zelensky you are talking about war rules in a country which is supporting genocide in Palestine!!!
Trumps trying to stop the war. Is that really a bad thing.
The opening statement of President Trump was enough to end this meeting. Unfortunately, the stress of the war and killing of the people of Ukraine made President Zelensky to make statements he shouldn‚Äôt have made. Simply use emotional intelligence and just appreciate the US for the support and reinforce the need to stop the war. Express your willingness to negotiate and don‚Äôt make any comments on President Putin. This was the best time to make a case, but it ended unfavorable for Ukraine. I can understand President Zelensky dealing with the stress and frustration of the war. But he should have controlled his emotion.
Zelenskyy didn&#39;t say anything wrong, but boy did he say it in the wrong room. It was the lack of self restraint in front of the media, even though Trump gave him an out, that triggered the fight.
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1440">24:00 That is where Trump starts getting agitated and the meeting starts to go off the rails. Zelenskyy had the temerity to correct Trump. How dare Zelenskyy to do that! üôÑ Trump&#39;s narcissism gets insulted and now he&#39;s angry. You can see it in his body language. But what&#39;s Zelenskyy supposed to do, just sit there and listen to Trump say things that aren&#39;t true, spinning things in Russia&#39;s favor? Nope. Zelenskyy had to speak up. Trump doesn&#39;t want to talk about security, because then he&#39;s on the hook for when Russia breaks the agreement. They never keep agreements. Zelenskyy is so correct. He knows because he has lived through it. Trump lives in a bubble and doesn&#39;t really care about Ukraine. He just wants a &#39;deal&#39;, so he can boast about it over and over. This is Trump.
Drump not normal !
This meeting was going great.  There are differences between Zelenskyy and Trump, but neither of them were stupid enough to bring up the differences (except in mild reference) during the meeting.  The meeting started downhill when JD Vance jumped in after President already wrapped the conversation up smoothly.   JD -- SLOW DOWN BUDDY.JD -- SHUT UP!   GROW UP!  You&#39;ve already BLOWN UP a great meeting!!!!  Idiot.  there will be no President Vance ü§ëü§êü§®Other than JD Vance - the meeting still ended peacefully.
Be more thankful. Lick my boots and be grateful. This is absolutely Horrendous
That‚Äôs a disgrace of these two American people, dictatorsZelenskyy is not wrong
Zelensky is beating round the bush.  Zelensky says that the rare earth deal is not enough.  He wants a security guarantees from the US before he signs the deal.  Just as Zelensky fell a prey to Boris Johnson in Istambul  so now he has fallen a prey to Macron and Starmer.  Vance intervened when Zelensky questioned Putin&#39;s credibility and that was right.  Trump is clear that the rare earth&#39;s deal has to preceed the ceasefire or a peace deal.The bout was not started by Vance.  Instead it was Zelensky who went on to question the meaning of diplomacy and here the conversation turned upside down.  Zelensky along with his European partners do not believe that this war can be ended by diplomacy.  They are hell bent on deciding it on the battle field.  So be it is what Trump said.Vance helped Trump conclude the press conference.  It also brought out the hipocracy of Zelensky and the west.  My question is why did Zelensky come to Washington if he was not ready to sign the deal without security guarantees from the US.  Macron and Starmer came to Washington to make Trump agree to a security guarantee.  Once Zelensky would have got it he would have flown back without signing the deal.  Trump did not fall a prey to this bait.
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=703">11:43 Trump is so gross here
JD Vance is an Idiot and should be called a Clown
the problem is that Trump can&#39;t offer a protection as Zelensky need. He would like to because of ;minerals; but it won&#39;t pass in congress

Zelensky, a real man! What all men should aspire to be. I hope to shake his hand one day.
Of course, Putin will never brake a deal with Trump!! Who, but those two know about the truth about the real deal better. Here it is!! Trump: Get me in White House, Putin: Not only I will put you in White House, if you let me occupy  Europe , I will make you  King of USA.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Putin wants this war to end? Great! Have him order his boys to pack up and leave. Why is our President acting like this is complicated? Russia invaded Ukraine. They don&#39;t want an end to the war, they want Ukraine. Sure, they&#39;ll sign a peace deal if it gives them land or Zelenskyy&#39;s resignation (so they can attempt to prop up a pro-Russia President), but that isn&#39;t because they want peace.
Always remember Trump is a business Man
What happened at the end there where Vance jumped in and intentionally ruined the peace talk (what‚Äôs in it for Vance) and then Trump jumps in‚Ä¶ seen it thousands of times‚Ä¶. minds incapable of completing a conversation because the brain is riddled with psychological war it creates chaos it‚Äôs self-destruction a typical abuse class would teach them they clearly know nothing about. They‚Äôre not comfortable in their own skin. Trump and Vance shouldn‚Äôt be leading this fkn meeting at all Vance should have shut the fk up.
Such a shame this went down hill so fast. It started off so good other than the suit question of course cos we all know wearing a suit is more important than preventing world war 3. Other than that JD needs to be sacked off. He didn&#39;t like the diplomacy response from Zelensky and his big ego got in the way. Way out of line! I think after that Trump could only double down and side with JDs ego and just became a complete playground in seconds. Keep your guy on a leash please Trump.
This reminds me a lot with America and Russia during WW2. Russia would&#39;ve got swallowed by Germany if it wasn&#39;t for American help. Yet they became our enemies. I feel like this maybe a eastern European mentality. ;We have more casualties so we have more ethical credit and we are in the right;
Utter humiliation to Ukraine, this interview has told one think, whatever you do try stand your own feet otherwise humiliation remains.
They both look at each other multiple times. Trump even complimented his outfit when that other asshole insulted it. Regardless, they&#39;re not speaking in a 1:1 scenario. They are speaking to the entire world.
This is awesome üòé

I must say, I am deeply disappointed by the lack of political education and the apparent disrespect shown by President Trump and Senator Vance toward President Zelenskyy. Throughout the interview, President Zelenskyy remained composed, respectful, professional, and honest‚Äîqualities that truly highlight his strength as both a leader and a human being.He is under immense pressure, defending his country and people from a tyrant, and yet he maintains his dignity. He deserves empathy and respect for the difficult position he‚Äôs in. It&#39;s hard not to feel vicarious embarrassment watching the way these leaders approached him, given his professionalism.President Zelenskyy is a great leader, and he deserves to be treated with the respect and understanding that any leader in such a critical role warrants. The arrogance displayed by some of the individuals involved is truly troubling. It seems as though their focus is more on personal gain rather than genuine support for Ukraine‚Äôs struggle.My respects go to President Zelenskyy for his resilience in facing such questions and the low standards of conduct.

Then, when there is a pretext to invade, real or imagined, they will try to take the country again, as quickly as possible next time around. Trump is so incredibly naive when it comes to Russia.

@ Ant that they could‚Äôve handled this much better instead of attacking each other.
Amazing content as always!
embarrassing!  I&#39;m a US citizen by the way.
@ Let‚Äôs just agree that they both went a little too far.
Trump is rude calling peoples&#39; questions ;dumb; and saying something seriously then say he&#39;s ;just kidding;.  He has no class or integrity. He is so egotistical! He always brings up Biden to smear him rather talking about THE ISSUES at hand, Trump is stuck in the past and sends out complaints of the past  ... what a baby! . Boy, ;One America News; are Trump&#39;s ego pumper, no hard questions from them. Putting is a thug and Trump is feeling sorry for him. ;I&#39;ve stopped many wars;. Trump is such a liar!  Vance ugly.  Trump doesn&#39;t have any nuances and Trump is disrespectful. Zelensky said ;thank you; right off the bat.
zelinky arguement was, the US diplomacy, under Trump, wont worth shit. unless they give give give to the green Tshirt. thats his arguement, in the diplomatic office of the US, against the current president of US.
WHAT IF HE BREAKS THE CEASE FIRE IS A VALID QUESTION and of course you deflect and go back to propagnada about former president ljke nobody cares trump. We care abojr the reason you say youre there to stop the war. Enough facade. Lets actually stop the war. Save people who cares ahout your self seeking motives trump.
America has never got a better president like Trump
It all looks as if Zelensky originally planned to beg for weapons, and the fossil deal is just an excuse for a visit. Trump needs a peace deal, not Zelenskiy, he made this clear when he said that Putin has already violated agreements and will break them again, clearly hinting that the issue should be resolved by force, not diplomacy
It&#39;s funny how cspan has a thumbnail with them smiling and all other channels show the actual look tgey had the whole time lmao
What a fucking joke, trump is talking out his ass and lying as usual, he has no idea what he is talking about. ‚ÄúRaw earth‚Äù üòÇ he means rare earth elements. the eu has in fact given more money to ukraine in aid than the usa has and thats just a statistical fact that can easily be looked up. Trump cant stop stroking his own ego and talking about the past long enough to answer any questions
@@artsycraftystudio Right, he&#39;s not a role model either.
I cannot agree more with President Trump. Ukraine does not have a chance to win this pointless war. If it wasn&#39;t for U.S. support, they would have lost in the first two weeks. Us, USA citizens should not have to continue supporting this pointless war. Ukraine has to be willing to give up and compromise. It is sad that Russia invaded, but remember that Gorbachev verbally expressed that after the dissolution of USSR, no eastern country would join NATO.
Hes saying cease fire has not worked becuae putin continues to do it. And does not play by the rules.  Hes not asking for mych. Zelensky was calm and communicative and vice president took it to a heated level. Then trump and him just spoke over him. Yes he said thank you. Yes vp was speaking loudly to create a narrative. That was played. You wanted to create a conflict to play this out. I saw early on that this was headed there with little chips and pokes.
Putin is a killer and a terrorist and he does need to be stopped. Truth telling isn‚Äôt moronic.
Why not ask him if he‚Äôs wearing designer socks and curling his eyelashes? Why not ask him if he likes country music the grand, old Opry and rap and hip-hop why not ask him questions that are irrelevant towards what‚Äôs going on in his country? Because it is a relevant to ask him what he‚Äôs wearing especially when he‚Äôs under so much stress he‚Äôs not thinking about his hairdo. He‚Äôs not thinking about getting a manicure. ‚Ä¶ these people are so out of touch they‚Äôre focusing on their next meal at McDonald‚Äôs and their necks, pedicure and manicure and their next visit at the spa and masseuse.
Zelensky called Vance the B word in Ukrainian/Russian before he called him disrespectful. <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2566">42:46-<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2568">42:48. If I hear it, Trump and Vance could too.
The man is at war ! He would be more comfortable in fatigues, not expensive suits  and shoes while his brothers and sisters are being murdered by invaders !!
I have never seen in my life on a television on the meeting of two presidents this type of ganging up on a person. Vice president is such a low of a human being that if I was a US citizen I would be very ashamed of having such a a** licker and phony person as a vice president. As for the Trump, basically because of the moronic vice president he got aggravated otherwise none of this talk would happen. Trump is not derived by patriotism or any of that, he has pure ambition which keeps on his drive function and as soon as Vance showed how good he was in a** licking same time he pressed on Trumps ambition and as every self oriented person would behave he set himself on the attacking position.Whatsoever, electing Trump for the second time can say a lot of  sad stuff about that percentage of nation. If to those ppl the most important stuff was kicking out the immigrants (immigrants who basically built that country) and hushing LGBTQ then truly, you deserve ‚ÄúTHAT THING‚Äù as your president.
Zelenski don&#39;t like JD. Simple as that. Zelenski askes with an attitude and disrespectful when he addressed JD insted of Mr VP. And if  not deplomacy then what is he saying? To fight ??

trump makes russia great again, miserable putin&#39;s doll
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1037">17:17. I just realized what Trump wants. He wants a Nobel prize, just like Obama got. Could this be his main motivator, to upstage Obama? Funnily, before that, Zelenskyy plays to Trump&#39;s narcissism, pointing at the wall, saying if he brings peace, Trump will be up there. There is a lot of psychology going on there. Zelenskyy, as much as Putin, and everyone else, knows that to get Trump to do what you want him to do, you play to his narcissism. It&#39;s Trump&#39;s Achilles heel.
This is disrespectful for US1. Zelensky want to have air defence may be F-352. Zelensky want have US Soldier in Ukraine to fight Russian3. Zelensky doesn&#39;t want mineral agreement 4. Zelensky said Russian must paid about 300 Billions Bill for US as the first country must paid it5. Zelensky give Europe about LNG and said Europe is more important than US. US have a Nice Oceans so why you are not just send your troops and get 350 billions by yourself6. Zelensky doesnt want ceasefire before get US security guarantees
First time in history of USA an American president (Trump) attempts to make deals with a dictator (Putin), instead of backing a democratic country in need.Freedom and liberty to Ukraine from Russia and its self-appointed Czar.Founding fathers must be turning in their graves.
‚Äã@@ClydeSimonSound Brainful takes here, as one would expect from a crotch shot pfp.
Something Trump can&#39;t provide because Trump is Putin&#39;s asset. How can a President be Patriotic if he&#39;s in a communist asset that is on the side of Russia and North Korea ? He was cornered with the Security Question and he expected Zelensky to except Trumps word was ;Gold;. He knew better it coming from an ;Unpatriotic Liar;.
It‚Äôs amazing to see some Americans still sympathize with Zelensky after he openly insulted their country in the media.
Zelensky body language amd attitude from the beginning is disrespectful....not ready for peace....
Trumpies your president is a yapping bozo. Holy hell if you think he talks sense, you probably dumber than he is.
Ask Chamberlain what the result of appeasement was.Crimea has been annexed by Russia previously, Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia (Putin) will not stop.
Idiot who asked about wearing a suit! JHC dipstick
idk what has been happening until this past in my tiktok fyp, but seeing the president of Ukraine with his body language is so sad, he is so humble and a true leader
Why do you think Zelensky is a despot? He desparately hopes to save his country. It was not his idea to make war. Even in the days before the Russian invasion he publically pretended to believe that Russia wouldn&#39;t attack the Ukraine.
Vance just made that meeting worst  Zelenskyy is just concern and wants to hear something that will make him feel safe what Putin might break again their agreement like he has in the past what‚Äôs wrong with him asking those questions poor guy for them to humiliate him like that on tv didn‚Äôt need to go there
Trump had answered that question already and he was pretty statist nodding all the time. There‚Äôs 2 things you might not realise. 1- his attitude changed when the Polish reporter brought up that irrational trigger about the USSR times, which it‚Äôs a bit irrational at this point. I get it when it‚Äôs someone in the pub, but you can‚Äôt be that emotional when you‚Äôre a freaking president. and 2- before Vance told him he was disrespectful and before the s*** hit the fan, he called the VP ‚Äúsuka‚Äù (the B word) on TV in the White House.
God bless = Zelenskyy&#39;s phrase meaning ;I hope to God this will never happen to you;. Anyone who has ever seen more than 3 interviews where Zelenskyy speaks English knows this. How can the US president and vice president be so unprepared to not know this wasn&#39;t a ;threat; by Zelenskyy?Yes, Americans feel safe. But that&#39;s an illusion. What do you think will happen when the world just lets Putin get away with his invasion? Doesn&#39;t punish him, even rewards him by trying to force Ukraine to make some sort of bad compromise. Other dictators will also start wars. Once we have lots of wars we&#39;ll have a worldwide recession. You think that won&#39;t affect the US economy? It&#39;ll be like 2008 but 10x worse.But leave it to lazy Trump to never have spent a minute thinking more deeply about this and then getting angry because he thinks Zelenskyy threatened him and that the US is invincible.
@ And then why did he come there at all, if Trump clearly indicated his position that he was going to resolve this conflict through diplomatic means. Is this the first time Zelensky has heard about this? Or did he think he would change Trump&#39;s mind? This is very strange
@@rw2452 Thanks for the replies and follow-ups. I&#39;m not convinced that&#39;s in the US&#39;s best interest, but maybe that&#39;s where we can agree to disagree.I do think even if that was the case: why were JDV and DJT so hostile and contemptuous of Zelensky? Why invite someone over to do a mineral deal and make a big public show of it and claim they&#39;re ungrateful? Why say you want to broker a peace deal at all?
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=927">15:27. Trump doesn&#39;t like that. He doesn&#39;t see, or even want, Russia troops withdrawing from Ukraine. He recently said as much, that it wasn&#39;t possible. He knows Putin will not agree to that deal. Trump is willing to give eastern Ukraine to Russia just to get a &#39;deal&#39;. He&#39;s selling out Ukraine. Zelenskyy knows Trump said this too, so he&#39;s just playing along at this point, trying not to upset Trump, though he has to get the point across that Russians are on Ukrainian soil. Zelenskyy&#39;s walking a tight rope at this point in the meeting, trying to stand up for Ukraine while simultaneously attempting to not piss off Trump. Man, I&#39;d hate to be Zelenskyy there. It&#39;s like playing with dynamite. It figures that during a whole hour it would eventually erupt in an argument. I&#39;m surprise it lasted this long without.
When does it start changing. Cause im falling asleep trying to listen to trump Also trump is not there to help the man .just wants the mineral. Eventhough he came to discuss other things.? Is that my understanding
This was very informative, appreciate it.
The way zelensky keeps shaking his head everytime trump mentions peace tells you everything you need to know.

The President of Ukraine came  to the United States. They have suffered tremendously and are affected. Everyone wants peace. God bless them. And someone asked, ;Why he didn&#39;t wear a suit ?;
JD concerned about his prideTrump concerned about Biden Zelinsky concerned about his people üò¢üôèüèΩ
@@TomSeliman99 The embarrassment is the Felon sitting there with his sidekick Vance.
Things were going well until JD opened his mouth.
The world around is blaming Trumph and sympathising zeelansky for all that ended this conference. But Trump was justified to claim that would not have allowed his war to start and Zeelansky has no justification to question that because the correct answer was that as he was stopping the war now. In fact Zeelansky was neither behaving nor using a parliamentry language as a president of a country but talked like a child repeatedly abusing president Putin at the floor of White house. However, the conference got biter when Zeelansky insisted to include security in the deal. Both the parties committed the mistake of holding the press conference before negotiating the deal and rather they were doing the stupidity of settlement of the deal through the conference.
Putin is a bully, as is Trump.  Trump&#39;s message to Zelensky: Appease the bully...Why? Because THAT&#39;S how Trump wants the rest of the world to act towards him. Just give the 13 year-old bully what he wants and everything will be okay.
Meanwhile putin watching this video with holding a chilled coke and popcorn in his hand
JD tweaking he fumbled the bag
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Also US and Europe put an inquiry and audit against Zelensky where all the supporting money goes..... With the help of Ukrainian officials..... May be he deposit all money in Russian banks
Great job, this video was very useful!

I loved how Very Stable Genius kept referring to rare earth minerals as ;raw earth, we don&#39;t have the raw earth.;
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
zelensky is a butcher of ukranians.
Why Vance was even talking.. absolute disgrace
Probably it would have been better for Selensky to discuss his points behind closed doors.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
President Zelensky said ;Thank you for...; four times and ;I appreciate...; as he touched his heart to add body language, then I stopped counting.Vice President Vance, do not point and use that tone. Pause, listen, understand, and respond if you choose to speak and interrupt two presidents at a conference.English is President Zelensky&#39;s third fluent language. Let&#39;s have empathy if we would like a synonym for ;loudly; because Vice President Vance raised his voice, pointed, and moved to the edge of his seat to explain that the President of Ukraine is not grateful for the ceasefire. Those of us with English as a first language might have said ;rudely; or ;irately,; and the passive-aggressive ones would have said ;with intense eye contact and one finger.;The President and Vice President must choose to improve their emotional intelligence. President Trump, yes, you wrote the bestseller ;How to Make a Deal,; but have you read ;How to Win Friends and Influence People;? Vice President Vance is going to make you look unpresidential and immature if you let him berate people who supported Kamala Harris which is irrelevant now, and he will derail you simultaneously.Please, get anger management to be global leaders now.
Trump going to be remember as the og president
This was super helpful, thanks!
How did the ;foreigner; disrespect them? These 2 bullies , trump and Vance are an embarrassment to your country. It&#39;s one thing to disagree, it&#39;s another to behave like school yard bullies.
What is lacking in this conversation is Zelensky mentioning that he is here to sign the deal Trump has designed.  So Zelensky has not come for signing the deal.  What Vance did was to bring him to the topic which Zelensky was side lining.
For starters. A flat NO to security guarantees. If Russia were to attack Ukraine, the US MUST get involved, and obvs one thing leads to another.Now remember awhile back, Ukraine shot a missile which ended up in Polish territory and LIED to the world pointing the finger to Russia. And again, Ukraine is a corrupt country, more corrupt that China.Can you REALLY trust a country to not lie to the world AGAIN, a corrupt country at that? What is stopping them from lying again to push the US into a war with Russia?And finally, Nordstream. My top two suspects are still US and Ukraine. An attack on infrastructure could happen again at the hands of both parties. Where do we go from here?I&#39;m sorry, considering where Ukraine ranks on the corruption index, and lied about the Polish missile event, I do not trust them with security guarantees.
Eyeliner wearing ass VANCE said ‚ÄúWe believe in Free Speech for the American people, BUUTTT Donald Dumb Duck is signing an Executive order to control the FCC and wants to fire or sue ANYONE on the airwaves who speaks the damn truth!!!! And did he just point out ‚ÄúCNN‚Äôs ratings?????‚Äù Wtfffff
Trump is UNBEARABLE to listen to. It&#39;s straight up torture. I feel SO BAD for Zelenski.
@SchoolVideosGoHere¬†  Trump is pulling out of Europe/Ukraine conflict with Russia. He stated that he&#39;s going to focus more on the American economy instead of national conflicts, cutting the military budget in half and wants a new nuclear disarmament deal. Looks like Europe has to start picking up Zelensky&#39;s tab.
@@ClydeSimonSound What peace deal? Trump and Vance were just mad that Zelensky didn&#39;t sign a deal that didn&#39;t include security guarantees but included stealing half of the money from Ukraine which is valued trillion of dollars.
I have deeply respect and honour for President Zelensky how dignified he is to his people and his country.
@@ClydeSimonSound He thinks putin won&#39;t honor any peace agreement. Trump providing more aid would discourage putin.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
;George Washington, Abraham Lincoln;. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Any other president would say, ;That&#39;s for history to decide&#39;. But Trump leapt at the chance to compare himself to the best, even though a compilation of rankings at Wiki has him very close to the bottom. That was his narcissism taking over, at the drop of a hat. That was a real laugher. Trump is such a ü§°.;You know I&#39;m only kidding; is an afterthought, once his real thoughts are revealed. It&#39;s an &#39;out&#39; for him, after planting the seed that he&#39;s the greatest. This is typical Trumpian behavior. We&#39;ve seen this &#39;out&#39; stuff over and over. God, he never stops patting himself on the back. It&#39;s hilarious.
Something worthy of note is that every time Trump talks about how the previous administration was useless there is not a word of protest from Zelensky.Whatever this man wants from the USA, clearly what the Biden administration has done is not anywhere near enough.Trump&#39;s diplomacy skills maybe lacking but Zelensky is a parasite and warmonger without a single diplomatic bone in his body.He is the lesser of three evils but he is a dangerous despot in his own right.
@ Yeah, that‚Äôs what I noticed, it started off good and then for some reason it just went off the rails.
Dude, he wasn&#39;t threatening him. He was warning them that this shit spreads. What do you think is going to happen when you go easy with a dictator who invaded his neighbors? Other dictators will see there&#39;s no consequences and do the same. When there&#39;s lots more wars in the world, do you think it will not cause economic problems for the US? That is why he said this about the nice ocean. Of course there will be no other military invading the US anytime soon. So it seems you&#39;re safe, right? But when there&#39;s a worldwide recession because everyone else is at war, the US will also go into recession. Think for 3 minutes! You want 2008 back?

Seeing this kind of behavior from my elected officials makes me feel genuinely ashamed. But seeing an allegedly grown man get red faced at not being able to fire the leader of a sovereign nation helps to lift my spirits a bit.
Trump is really a gineus. People who badmouth him didn&#39;t understand the root of that war..

It was weird. It was a relatively polite conversation for a while until it suddenly didn&#39;t.
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=724">12:04, again Trump is full of it. As a percentage of GDP some European countries have given more than the U.S. You can&#39;t expect some of the poorer nations, such as Portugal, for example, to be able to give as much. But Sweden, Netherlands, Poland, Britain, and I believe now France, have all given more than the U.S. Trump acts like we are making this unproportional sacrifice. We aren&#39;t. In fact, weapon-wize, what was given has been almost entirely old stock, due for recycle. It actually saves us money to send them to Ukraine because then we don&#39;t have to recycle them. Man, the dishonesty coming out of Trump is sometimes ridiculous.
As an American this exchange between Trump/Vance and Zelenskyy is embarrassing. A whole lot of gibberish from our end.
What  a clown zelensky is. He has banned the russian othordox church imprisoned journalists banned the russian language and jailed political opponents. Little dictator.

He‚Äôs in a war‚Ä¶.. he needs to look humble not flash, and that‚Äôs why he does not wear a suit.
@ he literally has been walked over 25 times this decade. It takes one google search. Of course he wants a guarantee. Jesus
Commie-publicans
The American people and the White house getting disrespected by a foreigner and then the woke left are still defending the foreigner, the woke left is really stupid! we really have a problem with this country. Let&#39;s fix our country first before we try siding with Zelensky and the Europeans. America first!
I&#39;m all up for world security but the way Trump administration spoke to the Volodymyr Zelensky was disgusting. That was so unprofessional and bullying people won&#39;t get you anywhere, America talks about helping people and their countries but forgets they won&#39;t be in the position they are currently in if it wasn&#39;t for it allies helping them in the first place. They going to lose alot of respect from other countries and support with this attitude if they carry on like this.
Zelenskyy wanted something for nothing and ended up with nothing

I&#39;m just gonna say this.... when a man defending his family is told, you don&#39;t feel any pain now, but you will;. As a father that is a threat against our lives... when a cop is told by a criminal&#39; ;you don&#39;t feel pain now but you will;. That is a threat towards that officer. Zelinskey just said to vance, ;you don&#39;t feel it now but you will; he threatened him, trump and the USA. Justified actions from trump/vance. Protect the usa like any father would protect his family.....
@@pr1nce.ca1ebi&#39;m sorry free speech is scary
We actually have real men as leaders now
Zelensky did a head shake no at 44 seconds in when Trump mentioned rare earth. Hi body language is so telling throughout this entire meeting.  He is an extremely entitled, arrogant little man.
JD Vance is an idiot!
@@TDawg-but-whitecontinually asking about security guarantees, something idiotic that would cause WW3.
I&#39;m extraordinarily proud of Trump and Vance.
You go to the front lines then clownboy
Trump is pushing for end of death, zelensky refuses it to keep making money for himself and his handlers. You really needed to write ur stupid little essay for what? This issue is simple af
At <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=700">11:40, on LNG. That is one of the main reasons Putin wants control of Ukraine. He doesn&#39;t want Ukraine supplying Europe with gas. He wants to supply it himself. You see, Ukraine not long ago discovered a lot more gas. There is lots of money underground in Ukraine and Putin wants it. Taking Ukraine is in part a business move, to control the gas market.
You are so wrong and an embarrassment
@@MrGarymuldoon You have ZERO proof of that.
Great job of Trump&#39;s and Vance‚Äôs Diplomacy in avoiding the Third World War (WW3) and rescuing the world from nuclear Catastrophe, which first-ever sky heights America&#39;s position to a global peace system over to solving international crises through diplomatic and peaceful measures, rather than going for an atomic destructive WW3 and protecting Europe &amp; Parts of Russian and other parts of the world to be radioactive ash. Zelensky is walking in the wrong way and has no return rather than putting Europe in catastrophe; there are no wins here... until and unless we stop this war game.

Trump&#39;s ‚ÄúAmerica&#39;s First‚Äù poses a fundamental shift that drives America from a war gambling mindset to putting forward a tangible and sustainable international peace and diplomacy system, solving most critical NATO-Russian conflicts and safer global issues quite peacefully rather than militarily. Now, ending the Ukraine-Russian conflicts creates a win-win takeaway for Europe and the international peace system, European self-reliance to much-needed safety &amp;  security agreement and peaceful co-existence with  Russia, and saving Europe from economic damages any further than fueling this war game!!!.

@@lenalou56no. Trump was already pissed. As soon as Zelenskyy disrespected him by directly contradicting him about the levels of European aid versus American aid, Trump was done. You can see it on his face WELL before Vance said anything.
Zelensky is anything but humble.
And then, how will Zelensky push for peace? Or does he want to convince Trump to provide more weapons under the pretext of a peace agreement?ü§î
The lady from CCN actially had good questions, to be fair. Theyre definitely tanking, but the question was deserving.
Did Zelenskyy even get to eat lunch or did he get kicked out hungry and victim shamed by the orange clown and his yapping poodle?
zelenskyy is getting rich and ukrainean people are suffering but only the poor one cause the rich one&#39;s are out of the country and they are doing good.... zelenskyy don&#39;t want to end the war , he doesn&#39;t care about the people...

You did NOT give them 350billion. You mostly gave them old weapons and ammo that were due for recycling (which is very expensive) in a few years anyway. You then bought yourself shiny new weapons for 100-something billion from your own defense industry, creating jobs for Americans. And then you turned around and pretended that the price you paid was the value of the old stuff.Meanwhile, Europe does not have as many old weapons lying around and can&#39;t cheat like this, so they had to give mostly real money. And still gave more than the US, even if we take the US value at face value. Europe has paid about 60% of the total war effort.And you need to compare not small countries with large ones. You don&#39;t compare what Rhode Island gave vs what Germany gave either. You need to compare things with the same size. By number of people, that would be the US vs the EU. Which comes out <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=3050">50:50. Or you compare by percent of GDP given. If you do a fundraiser and there&#39;s a working class dude and a rich millionaire, you don&#39;t praise the millionaire for giving $100 (which is small change to him), you expect him to give more. It would be fair if the working class dude gave x% of his small paycheck then the millionaire should also give the same x% of his paycheck if he wants the same praise, right? Guess what, if you go by percent of GDP given, the US isn&#39;t even in the top 10 of donors.I&#39;m not holding it against the US because you did give a lot and in absolute terms your country is the biggest donor. But stop comparing apples and oranges and stop whining as if you were getting betrayed. Everyone else pays as well.And the US is the only country that profits - because the whole war is like a huge ad for your defense industry. You gave 4 dozen  30 year old versions of HIMARS to Ukraine and everyone was impressed by their performance. Poland alone ordered 500 (!) brand new ones. Every country that gave its old planes ordered new ones from the US. Your order books are full for the next decade and you got a spectacular return on investment.But you really need to stop being so obnoxious to all your allies. Because if you continue like this, those orders WILL go elsewhere. People do NOT like being bullied by what&#39;s supposed to be their friends. The US had the best deal in this war and you probably just blew it. I would not be surprised if countries will cancel their orders now because the US is not a trustworthy ally anymore. And if Zelenskyy gives the rare earth mineral deal to the EU.
@ Vance is one to talk about disrespect, allying with Germanys far right party, real mature of him. üôÑ
@@rw2452it literally happened and was ongoing through Trumps presidency. The recent invasion happened in 2022, but Trump literally did nothing to broker peace in 2015
Are you dumb? Did you listen? He&#39;s willing to give the minerals up, but not without American military backing.

Watched the whole thing. Trump and Vance still look like Russian plants and Zelensky looks like the one with inner strength. Trump wants the Ukraine to trust that he is magical fairy and that Russia will behave because of his special pixie dust. Smh.
None of the libs seem to remember Biden losing his temper with Zelensky because of his ungrateful, arrogant attitude. Very short memories y&#39;all have.
Jd Vance should have shut his mouth. He used no common sense to input what he said. Everything was going smoothly until Vance opened his mouth.
@SchoolVideosGoHere¬†  I read your post in my notifications. I hate it when YouTube hides comments.
Simple Dialoge is at First PartTrump : ;i want to end the war at now so lets compromise with Russian;Zelensky : ;i don&#39;t want compromise  to Rusian because Putin is killer and kidnappers, this is a document i gave you fact this.;Journalist : ;how much money we going invest for security guarantees;Trump : ; I will make a mineral deal agreements, and invest in that, and with that we can get money and security guarantees from Ukraine and end the war;Zelensky : ; We have biggest LNG storage  and we will send it to Europe;Trump : ;Europe is give much less how unfair you treat us like that, but lets go to the business;The Trump answer the Journalist and tell about his archievement. Zelensky : ;
President Trump wants to do a deal first and then later look at the question of security deals in detail, while President Zelensky wants security guarantees to be part of the deal, even if they only count for around 2% of the detail.There seems to be very strong common ground between what Zelensky is asking for and what The US Vice President noted at around <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2410">40:10.  After criticizing the previous US administration, he says ;The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States words, matter more than the President of the United States  actions ...;The alignment here between what the VP says and Ukraine needs is precisely that the deal must include guarantees of action and not just chest thumping words.
Musk isn&#39;t a statesman
JD got b-hurt because Zelensky called out that this has been going on since 2014 and has seen 3 different presidents including former Trump, so why all of a sudden do other countries want to interject. I am a proud American til the day i die but i have to say this turned into more of a bullying ambush because Zelensky was speaking plainly (which may or may not have been the correct setting or time to do so, but while our 2 leader&#39;s were tooting their own horn, it opened that floodgate for rebuttal). Now of course Zelensky has his own agenda that he won&#39;t speak this honest about publicly, but the &#39;say thank you&#39; bs was so cringe to watch. He will get money from the UK to get his equal revenge on Russia then in a couple years peace talks may actually happen. I&#39;m all for him getting his revenge, assuming I&#39;m educated on the subject enough to think Putin randomly with no cause invaded the Ukraine. I also love Trump but sometimes he does go too far with his wording and demeanor, while also having to let everyone know how strong America is and we bend over for no one. Agree or Disagree this is what keeps countries from ever thinking to invade America, real leadership and strength projection (while also obviously being able to back it up). Unfortunately this took away from the point of Ukraine is in trouble, but by the way look at how great America is........ Either way my opinion is that Zelensky is of course grateful as he has stated many times and obviously has said thank you before, but your asking a countries leader to get on his knees and start J&#39;ing you off on national television is a bit silly... He still has to appear strong for his own country as naive and short-sighted JD and Trump came off. My 2 cents.
@ i hear you but you really think he was talking about russia and ukrainian? he said 2 smaller countries?
Stealinsky is a greasy little criminal.
When Z asked JD if he&#39;s ever been to Ukraine, JD should have asked Z if he had ever been to America&#39;s heartland because those are the people funding his war thru taxes. This guy Z wants USA $ to fight his war not Ukraines minerals sold to fund it. That&#39;s why he&#39;s pissed. DT did a great job. JD needs some work.

What Trump needs is development contracts in Ukraine, because that would make him richer. He repeatedly uses government policy to manipulate others into funneling wealth into his family.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Vance called Zelensky on his blatant disrespect. We lost nothing.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
They want a deal so they can raid the riches $$$$$$
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
@ He said raw earth not raw materials.
@ he was grateful and respectful but he came at jd over the diplomacy thing, jd was speaking about his research and Z was speaking about his ‚Äúexperience‚Äù in his country or whatever he meant. so they basically get pressed for no reason and jd just stood on american business as i would expect him an trump to do
He will always find a way to plug in how high the numbers were for the votes and did that idiot ask why doesn‚Äôt he wear a suit?? Meanwhile Musk didn‚Äôt wear a suit AND had his damn son wiping boogers on Donald Trump‚Äôs desk!!!! Wtf!!
And then how is Zelensky going to make peace if ;Russia never fulfills its obligations; ? It seems that he came to ask for military aid in exchange for rare earth metals, and Trump needs peace, not Zelensky. It seems that Zelensky was not going to sign the peace and hoped to convince Trump
Job, good job, job...

@@01yb200 Sorry you can&#39;t see what the majority of people see here. Vance started it around <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2340">39:00. Let me ask you, would you tolerate someone talking to you like that, let alone 2 people talking down to you? Most people would have walked out of there. Zelenskyy maintained amazing composure. He is a president who has gone thru hell, he is not a child. He deserves respect, empathy and compassion.
It&#39;s not the best idea to show up to a job interview in your pajamas. You can be a Ukrainian clown, but when you come to the Oval Office, you dress up like a statesman. If you walk in there in your casual look, don&#39;t bring any gifts and just make demands - then you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if you are humiliated as a fool and chased out of court.
It&#39;s time someone put the cokehead dictator who&#39;s not even Ukrainian in his place.
I think that Americans feel safe. But no one says how bad Zelensky&#39;s phrase sounds when he says: ;You have a nice ocean and don&#39;t feel now, but you fill it in a future God Bless...; You cannot say a sentence like that in front of the president (as crazy as he may be) of the United States.
Im looking him, (zalenskyy)  afraid something i dont know
See how full of himself he is: it is not just America who decides, it is I, the one who stopped numerous unnamed wars, I, who is ;respected; (;feared;). We are going to make a deal, a deal... what deal are you talking about? What kind of peacemaker you are? No way you care about peace if you are being patronizing and arrogant like that during negotiation. Ignoring the fact that the whole thing is laced with air of condescension and ingratiation, the last part is a pure stream of ignorance and disrespect.
Bought and paid for by the CCP.As was Biden.
Schoolyard bullies.
trumb is idiot
This should not have been public. LIke a couple having a fight and having all the neighbours over to watch/listen.  Everyone is going to pick a side. Sort your shit then show us smiley faces.
People are dying and this fool is worried about a suit. What a weenie. Zelensky is being humble, but you can see he&#39;s just confused, reasonably, about people&#39;s bizarre statements.
Trump must have a crush on Biden, man keeps talking about him like a bad breakup.
@1yb200 You didn‚Äôt even have the courtesy to spell out the president of Ukraine‚Äôs full name in your comment. Zelenskyy. The bias you carry is so deep in your psyche that you are not in control.
What a joke of a president you Americans have chosen
The meeting was going smoothly until JD Vance interjected with an ill-conceived question, which derailed the discussion and led to an unfortunate conclusion. His exchange with Zelensky turned confrontational, and instead of maintaining composure, Vance took it personally, steering the conversation in a negative direction.Vance felt embarrassed after being rebutted by Zelensky and deliberately brought up Zelensky‚Äôs previous support for Biden in an attempt to shift the focus or regain control of the situation.
The comment from the Little Sir bout the suit was very unfortunate and bad he‚Äôs bad.
his way of convincing his truth helped his army before. but that doesnt work on smart people. yes he had to sign. if Ukraine is american territory. then its over in one day..   but zelenski.. üò¢ wants to fight back. if russia takes that part of Ukraine now then it will be that. but if ukraine becomes the military ninja master and then becomes russia.  then the eu can sing a farewell song. well zelenski, both sides have to give, even putin looked trough his hand for that deal. giving up his target to a friend for economic welfare and border security. no, he keeps fighting the russian power with lives and next with european lives. but not American lives.  a chance to stop a war in one day is not easy and zelenski just couldn&#39;t. incompetent. doesnt want to give up, lives like before 2014. doesnt understand that russia is expanding too and that can be done with deals, not war. I&#39;m a european and i even understand amerika.  trump should make a deal.  zelenski signs or no more Americans in Nato...  this would learn the eu leaders a lessen on how to deal with conflicts.  eu was not ready,  ukraine was not ready.  Russia is.  if amerika joins russia. that will end the war too.  with a deal or with a even bigger war. goodluck zelenski
This ;deal; appears to involve Ukraine handing over their mineral resources to the USA, in return for which Putin will retreat from Ukraine  ???  What am I missing? üòÆ

@@01yb200what did he do exactly? What magical footage is there of him being ungrateful or rude? Numerous angles, cameras, and testimony say he was nothing but respectful
Clearly JD Vance wasn‚Äôt listening because President Volodimer Zolinsky said Thank you several times within the Oval Office meeting! He (Vance) made things worse with his rude interjections!
Zelenzki is a clown. A prepotent and dangerous person. He is a disgrace for world peace. A clown that believes he has made all the progress all alone. He should be kissing Trumps‚Äô shoes, instead of being such an as whole
Vance is the weak link
You explained this so well, thank you!
Big difference between having 300 billion and asking for 100 billion.
Those photos of Ukrainians held prisoner by Russia are interesting. When the war started, Russian commanders were told to treat Ukrainians harshly, that conventions about ethical treatment didn&#39;t apply. So, they&#39;&#39;ve been torturing and starving Ukrainian prisoners. I doubt many Americans even know about that. That behavior is consistent with other Russian war crimes, such as rape and pillage - Bucha being the most-known example.
Jd is not the sharpest knife in the drawer
Trump and Vance are psychos. God help our country and Ukraine.
With much respect to Zelenskyy and Ukraine‚Äôs withstanding of  a most vicious war - Zelenskyy could have raised his concerns about Putin‚Äôs credibility without making the entire meeting look like he‚Äôs challenging Trump‚Äôs capabilities. I think he should have worn a suit - not only in the physical sense, but also in the conventional sense, which is to address issues of concern in an elegant way, employing good faith and gratitude as common grounds rather than trying to ‚Äúeducate‚Äù everyone in the room.
Fuck JD. Fuck Trump. Give Zelenskyy , in writing, that Putin HAS to follow rules.  Do not give the US any rate earth. Europe, take us out! This is so sad.

Before the presidency, Trump, I was praying to come,  but after what I see now, how he does not respect anyone and even did not respect the presidents before him by the unified statements.And now JD Vans could not answer Selensky and ignite the fire of strife, and changed the subject of thanksgiving.After that, Trump began to attack him without respect.The most ridiculous notes were, the question about the wearing of Zellinski. Who do they think themselves and what right they treat a head of state in this way?Everyone is here in Europe and the Arab countries criticizing Trump and Vans.The Lord blesses Ukraine and his peopleüôèüá™üá∫üá©üá™üáÆüá±üá±üáß üá∏üá¶
That‚Äôs the most retarded thing I‚Äôve ever read. Ukraine should not get something for nothing
Fucking joke this is. Bullying our potential partner but we know why we know who‚Äôs biding he‚Äôs doing. Yes talk about Ashley lol. If this is diplomacy I wonder what foreign policy looks like.
Zelenskyy seemed like he was on drugs; anyone else notice that? Fidgety and sniffling and opening eyes very wide then rambling among many other signs. Def on stimulants.
How more thankful does he want him to be?
I feel for Zelensky to have to sit there with two turds

ngl zelensky pulling out the pictures was so stupid. like yeah we get it that&#39;s why we&#39;re trying to stop the war. idk if he was like trynna guilt trip trump out of the mineral deal and just end the war out of spite so he doesn&#39;t have to give the US anything but like i didn&#39;t see the point in showing the prisoners

@@rw2452 It looks like my reply didn&#39;t post. To super sum it up: you&#39;re right and Zelensky would agree.But Ukraine has done an amazing job holding off and pressuring Russia with US and European support. Russia is struggling. And Ukraine&#39;s one card (beside faith in their should-be-allies) is that the world where Russia is allowed to continue conquering is <i>much worse</i> for the US. USSR resurgence, China emboldened to take Taiwan, other nations disrupting peace and trade, etc. The US sending ~$100 billion in old weapons and money (that Ukraine then uses to buy supplies from American businesses) is <i>not</i> some purely altruistic thing. The US benefits in the short-term and long-term.
US is a 50 countries.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
@ Yes, absolutely. For the first 30 mins Trump was accommodating Zelensky and being diplomatic. But then Zelensky challenged JD Vance in a very combative way. Not to mention in November, Zelensky involved himself in the US elections by not just endorsing Harris, but openly being critical of a Trump presidency, with JD as VP. What a stupid thing to do,  considering there was always going to be a high chance Trump would win and Zelensky would have to deal with him!
he said you would feel ;influence;
I can see exactly what pissed Trump off. Zelenskyy was way too antagonistic by calling Putin a ;killer; and ;terrorist; and twisting phrases like ;stop the war; into ;stop PUTIN;. Pretty poor way to covey yourself at the start of PEACE negotiations. How is this going to help get Putin to discuss peace with Ukraine when this moron is still name calling. What a fool this man is.
;I never compare myself to anyone.; Hm. Ok. Also, that comb over üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
Lol yeah Zelenskyy definitely saw a narcissist expert for this meeting he‚Äôs got photos he‚Äôs leaning in he‚Äôs got soft speech absolutely everything the narcissist will detach from for all to see on screen
vance might have said something to upset Z, but the way that Z acted in the office was just unacceptable, so vance and trump snapped back. i‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt see that
Love the fact trump asking Europe to do more wish we had yt/ and tic tok during the 2 world war where where USA until the damn end glory yeah
What is this idiot Zelensky talking about‚Ä¶that Putin hates Ukrainian people‚Ä¶Ukrainians and Russians are one and the same nation, one and the same people‚Ä¶Ukraine was part of Russia in the past‚Ä¶They share one and the same language except some different accent that Ukrainians have. This one should stop the drugs immediately!

The moment this Interview got lit was heated. üòÖüòÖüòÇ
Why does Biden figure so prominently in Trump&#39;s feebly mind. Biden is out he is in. Trump brokered the Afghanistan deal see how that turned out for the Taliban.
<b>@rw2452:</b> You can&#39;t believe Zelensky was threatening to attack the United States. He said himself they have a nice big ocean protecting them. His point is that Trump giving Putin what he wants will embolden him, and that eventually US security will be threatened, too. That&#39;s Zelensky&#39;s prediction, and I think the US would be smart to listen to him. But we&#39;re talking about Donald Trump here, so . . . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
and trump would be out of office in 4 years. enough rest time for putin to attack again
Loved the content, keep it coming!
It must have been very obvious to Zelenskyy that this administration is more interested in sniping at democrats than in helping the Ukraine. So embarrassing!
Even of Vance was nasty with Zelensky, if Zelensky would have been more composed it would have ended all good and maybe Trump would say something nasty to Vance in private for this. But Zelensky was arogant, and Trump felt that even if he was attacked by Vance, he is in no position to bite back. In the end I think Trump got what he wanted, with the help of Vance and Zelensky, he can succesfully go on the ukraine exit ramp.
Putin offers peaceful mediation between Trump and Zelinsky? It&#39;s like when &#39;THE OWL IS SHOUTING TO THE SPARROW - YOU&#39;VE GOT A BIG HEAD&#39;.
Without the USA, Ukraine would be doomed. There needs to be a discontinuation of the war entirely and President Trump needs both President Zelensky and President Putin to cooperate to end the war! If President Zelensky and President Putin don‚Äôt want that, then we will not side with either with them.
First of all Zellensky was the reason for he first Trump impeachment, then he campaigned with the democrats to beat Trump! Do you honestly think Trump likes him?
Canada also changed the names and the spelling of names who came into the country and that was before the Second World War so he can stop trying to make out Russia as ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù the fkn everyday normal is a fkn ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù everywhere it‚Äôs human trafficking disguised it has nothing to do with freedom and people building lives it‚Äôs traffickers building just another fkn idea whooptedo
They‚Äôre so dense delusional with power and perhaps naive? To think that they know that a Dictator like Putin is willing to negotiate a ceasefire. Zelenskyy knows Putin and Russia better than anyone and he knows they‚Äôll renege on their deal.
He almost never answers the questions directly ‚Ä¶ unless someone asks him an ego-stroking question.
Yes, the American people saw what was going on. You and Shady Vance were rude to a valorous man who is fighting to save his country. Both of you need to be spanked (or worse). He is our ally, not your toy to abuse. You put us in bed with Putin, and for that, you are traitors. Most of us in the U.S. don&#39;t agree with that setup of Pres. Zelensky. I wish you could know this, but you&#39;ve got your propaganda machines hiding everything from you. They won&#39;t tell the truth of how upset we all are about your handling of anything at all. The resistance will show you incompetent people in this administration. Go away!

Zelenski wants to continue this war because there is a lot of money involved to steal by his team.
America signed as a guarantor, if you don&#39;t pay the bank installments, the guarantor automatically pays, the law obliges it because in the case of Ukraine, some essential goods were traded to Ukraine for national security, which benefited Russia to Putin, who signed a treaty in which he guarantees all the crazy things he does to Ukraine that he will never do them. Trump and Putin must be held accountable, in this context they no longer represent the states in which they are presidents. It is not possible for one person to speak against what they represent without consequences and the rest to sleep in slippers, it is not possible for 2-3-4 old men to endanger an entire planet because that&#39;s what they want, or are the times when we burned witches at the stake and beat our neighbors to take their food or a piece of land over? These characters do not represent us, they talk about diplomacy, but they violate rules that they are obliged to respect by their own signature, then what is diplomacy? They must resign, they no longer represent democracy and are a threat to our safety through their own decisions made based on emotions.
Please President Trump we seek for your help to remove the dictator Museveni in Uganda, now 45 years üôè
Extort? Ukraine owes us billions! This is a way to get repayment!
It&#39;s incredible to me how naive people in the comments are. This is not Trump simply deciding to disrespect Zelensky. This is a performance that they are all putting on together. The US establishment needs an off ramp for this failed proxy war against Russia. Zelensky needs this because it&#39;s the only way to tell his people that ;look we have no other choice;.It&#39;s not Trump&#39;s call. It&#39;s the ruling class of America.

@coolbeasty5934  sure, i don&#39;t remember everything he said but from what i remember:1. Russians are starving Ukrainians hostages. LIES. Russians are actrually saving Ukrainian soldiers from bullets of their own soldiers, their own guys are killing those Ukrainians who&#39;s trying to surrender to Russians. Why would they starve them after? lots of vids on the web 2. Russia started this war. LIES. Ukraine started shelling Russian speaking region of Donbas after US illegaly overthew their president in 2014 and installed Poroshenko who started shelling civilians in these areas (watch Oliver Stone&#39;s ;Ukraine on Fire;)3. Putin broke ceasefire agreements 25 times. LIES. Ukraine broke 2 peace agreements. First one is Minsk agreement in 2019. They continued shelling people in Donbas after signing it. (watch Oliver Stone&#39;s ;Revealing Ukraine;) and the second one Minsk 2 peace agreement was reach in March of 2022 and was signed by Ukraine, but Boris Johnson on the behalf of the Biden came to Ukraine and ordered Elensky to broke the agreement. Just type this topic here on YT.
Every time I watch this I just laugh at the foolery. Trump is trying to force a deal down Zelenskyy&#39;s throat, and Zelenskyy isn&#39;t swallowing. He knows what Trump is up to, and Trump is up to Russia, neck deep. What does Trump expect to get out of Putin for saving his azz? Is it still about a Trump Moscow hotel? Watch Zelenskyy. He knows he&#39;s listening to Putin&#39;s operative in DC., and when he pushes back, he knows he&#39;s pushing against Putin. Trump seems to think Zelenskyy will cower under the might of the big bully. Nope, not when Ukraine has Europe to fall back on. Europe tanks Trump&#39;s chance at a crooked deal. Even Vance throwing his two cents in doesn&#39;t cower the Ukrainian president. What a sham meeting. Zelenskyy came to DC knowing it was a bull session for Russia. And there we have it, American foreign policy under Trump. Crooked enough for some to call treasonous. Zelenskyy, on the other hand, is like a Churchill - strong and determined. Churchill wouldn&#39;t cave either.
I tried, but I couldn&#39;t stand to watch this shitshow for very long. It&#39;s very uncomfortable for me to say, and it breaks my heart to do so, but I hate my country right now. It&#39;s less comfortable for me to say nothing and ignore that this administration has now made The United States of America one of the world&#39;s bad guys. Maybe the biggest, most dangerous, and most stupid bad guy. We are now a part of the ;Axis of Evil.;

Trump gambled away with Putin and took his frustration out on Zelensky. No, blamed Zenelsky to make a fool out of the US-Americans. Putin is not interested in peace but in normalising economic relations with the USA so that he can continue the war. And Trump joined in and catapulted the USA out of the ;Free World;. Trump is no dealmaker but a turncoat and fraudster. That&#39;s all there is to say on the Oval Office story.

Ukraine is losing very badly and they lost around 1mil+ soldiers. Analists say on the battlefield there&#39;s 1 Russian death on 10 Ukrainians. So it&#39;s easy to count. But those number are very very tragic anyway.6. I think he said that his people want US to continue send weapons and money to Ukraine. LIES.

If you look at the maps you&#39;ll see how much land Russian military took for these 3 years. And why would he hunt people on the street to throw them out to the frontlines against their will if they aren&#39;t losing badly.

He is desperate because without Biden he can&#39;t keep the billions he can&#39;t use or hide the billions, the Biden administration got their money off to the sunset and this guy risks having nowhere to hide on this planet.

To be honest.. trump let him do all the talking.  Everyone is tired of this war.  Its costing everyone billions USA and Europe footing the bill thru tax payers money.. zalensky wants to be the hero but is nothing more than a media whore who never even seen a gun but yet he walks around in military atire.

Men of fighting age here in ireland are sitting in pubs, drinking all the time, telling everyone how they are winning this war. all they do is complain but yet they fly back to Ukraine for dental work, weddings etc .. trump is right . Take the deal if not ur on your own. And good luck to ya.. why should everyone foot this war bill just because zalensky wants to be seen as a hero.

Well, the US should put pressure on Putin then. Putin invaded and killed people and stole land and children. Russia is going almost bankrupt, just tighten the sanctions and call your friends the Saudis to pump a bit more oil for the price to go down and give a couple more long range weapons to Ukraine so they can take out a few more Russian refineries and that evil dictatorship is going to fall in 6 months. Why does the US ;negotiate; with Russia as if the US was in a weak position and needed to grovel to Putin? Never saying anything tough to the Russians, meanwhile calling Zelenskyy a dictator, dismissing his arguments and shouting at him? While demanding he fork over his country&#39;s natural resources in return for no security guarantees?

I could not be more disgusted at the media and how they repeatedly did not let President Zelensky answer questions. I love our President and Vice President but both were completely out of line and freaked out when Zelensky said the US could feel it - all he was saying is that this shit spreads
Zelensky has shown true dignity. Trump and Vance, on the other hand, it is truly shameful to have witnessed your words.
Why can Musk wear a hat, Texas belt buckle, t shirt and futuristic suit jacket and not be underdressed in the oval office, but a president in a war showing solidarity with his soldiers is a problem.
and no one asked ;wouldn&#39;t that be an incitation for China to go further with its expension;

@ ;Russia shouldn‚Äôt get to walk out of this with square INCH ; I somewhat agree (they shouldn&#39;t) but at what cost? Jonah, sometimes good countries loose wars... The Ukrainians are losing even with all of our arms, the only next step is NATO. Are you ready to step into WW3 because I sure as hell am not!
The anti-Trump forces don&#39;t want negotiations between Trump and Putin. Putin proposed the new administration solve the problem with cost recovery in Ukraine through the joint development of rare earth metals. Will the anti-Trump allow negotiations to happen? They sent Zelenskiy to disrupt the agreement.
i don‚Äôt even blame Zelensky for leaving because quite literally everyone in the meeting room was being so disrespectful towards him.
Gratitude is the spice that makes life beautiful. Extending this interview in public was not a good idea. When differences are emphasized by the media there‚Äôs no place to go but conflict. Lovers after disagreement go to bed. There are no lovers here. Trump is right. Stop the killing, negotiate the details afterwards. The press always trying to sensationalize. What if what if. It‚Äôs not smart, it‚Äôs not sensitive. It actually can derail peace talks
EU have already funded it more than the US
Okay Trump said that if he was president last term this war would&#39;ve never happened? Well Putin is greedy and has broken into Ukraine in the past and he is greedy and is probably after all of the metals and goods in Unraine. My question is how would have u stopped Putin and his greed. Why wouldn&#39;t have Putin invaded Ukraine if you were president. What is it that you think would stop him.

Some spammers say about drugs. No matter. Did you live under rocket attacks until 3 years? No! You will use drugs to save your mental health if you are not masochist.
Zelensky generally imposed his point of view, they tried to explain to him that he would have to make compromises for the sake of peace, but he does not even want to hear about it and repeats the same thing. The situation is changing, but Zelensky&#39;s rhetoric is not
The rare earth minerals are the payment Ukraine owes for the billions that was lent to them! It will also offer security by the US while they are in Ukraine!

When Zelensky tells about 2014, he forgets to say that he refused to be soldier than after two or three calls he even did jokes about this and said later that he doesn&#39;t have duty to anybody but his parents and was continuing making Russian humor. Now he closed borders and created violent street conscription of poor men with lot of violation of human rights. Thanks man J.D. for words about Zelensky forcing conscripts to the front line etc... It&#39;s so true. And dont forget about huge corruption of Zelensky government!
As a Trump administration supporter, JD embarrassed us. This would&#39;ve been an easy meeting and deal. JD was acting like a barking dog that wouldn&#39;t shut up which forced Trump to pick sides. üôÑ

Look up what Churchill wore when he came to the US to get weapons for Britain during WW2.

Zelensky took a tough stance, not wanting to make any compromises. Trump tries to explain that reality does not correspond to the desires of both sides of the conflict, but Zelensky claims that he is not ready to give in to Russia. Why did he even come here to impose his point of view?

I do. Trump&#39;s not human, he&#39;s a businessman.
What I have observed in the whole conversation is that Zelensky defended himself in this uncomfortable situation. JD Vance and Trump completely disregarded diplomatic norms in the meeting with an official of a country which is fighting against aggression
What a disgraceful display from our leaders. Did you see how Trump put his hand on president Zelensky? How do you think chunk would react if it was reversed.? This was a total setup and the whole world knows it
You must be dumb.
No, Chump, you are not a peacemaker. You&#39;re an opportunist and President Zelensky smelled it. You&#39;re the one who is going to cause WWIII, cheeto-head. You have never taken accountability for anything unless it was in your favor. You take credit for other people&#39;s accomplishments. Mistakes? Never. Despicable human being. THIS was a scandalous mistake and you need to stop blaming Pres. Biden. People voting for you were in severe error.

Thank you cspan for the entire clip. Seems to me Vance just wanted to put his two cents in and Zelensky, for no good reasons, started on a history lesson.  Zelensky keeps his mouth shut for ten seconds and lets Vance have his little moment and none of this happens.  Zelensky is amateurish.  Calling him jd and not Mr vice president.  Zelensky is an amateur.  And then that whole asking if he&#39;d been to Ukraine as if that matters.  Zelensky set Vance off and then he went too far with the manpower comment.  Zelensky is amateurish he needs to walk into that meeting hat in hand instead he&#39;s litigating.  And then when he says USA is going to feel the war that was unacceptable to any USA president I&#39;m glad Trump shit him down at that point
they cut him out as much as they could and kept interfering when he tried to answer not to mention he remained polite and said &#39;thank you&#39; multiple times but they kept that 3 minute clip doing rounds in sns to paint zelensky as the one who was out of line

You some kind of psycho problem may be frustrations of wars make you like this... U looks not normal now... U were sitting there and talking and interrupting Trump like you r the president of USA and Trump from Ukraine..... First of all never show the pics because its make bad moods.... Second you were going there for his help and support but you were admires other countries in front of him again and again.... Third he is trying to make a deal so all things will be fix but you were asking security guarantees if there a person who trying to use his positive power for peace deal then let him to do that but you telling the nonsense talks.... Now its go in mess u destroyed it.... Its not gonna work now but yes only one way Ukraine can do that..... Remove Zelensky immediately...... Choose new intelligent person and then send him to trump and he will request to him for help and tell him that you are the only person who can make this deal.... Other countries are standings behinds you.... Please make a peaceful deal so this war ended up... Its look like Zelensky is not happy for peace deal he just want money and he not happy that Trump stopped this war he making mad to him so he get more money from Europe and USA...... Thats why he not happy with trump because trump not issueing funds but he want to stop war and Zelensky is not happy for this...... Just remove Zelensky because he dont want peace..... Just imagine u sitting in that country and saying no one nation in the world like Ukrainian no one have culture like Ukrainian etc etc he dont know manners and dont know formalities...... And what abt that stupid reporter question when trump start giving the answer and he start to ask second question to Zelensky and Zelensky ask to trump what he asked and trump repeating so much play ful games..... Makes trump hyper.... The reporter must say first if they have two questions then they say we have two questions so they ready to listen second question too but when he starts answering then he start second question... Its look like all trap... But trump is so smart when he say what he asked then he repeatedly said the sort of stupid question.... Trump 2.0 Reloaded

If there was any hope left in Trump as a person it went up in the smoke of this dumpster fire.
Why on earth is this excuse for a president so insecure that he has to mention over and over again that he won the election? Isn&#39;t it obvious? What is he talking about ;raw earth;? Was nobody able to tell him that the deal is about rare earth - and maybe also let him know what it is he is talking about? Would help if he at least would appear educated. And why does he keep repeating that Europe is only extending loans to Ukraine? Just the old and proven method repeat lies over and over again and the public to busy to research for the truth will believe it. Despicable - the entire situation. I have lost all respect for these people -  lacking honesty as well culture.

Actually, the US, UK, and Russia (what irony) should. Ukraine gave up its nukes in the 90s, these countries signed up to guarantee their safety. Later, China and France also signed.

@@speedstyle. I think the hardcore point is to keep Russia from kidnapping, torturing, beating, and killing Ukrainians, and to return all the kidnapped Ukrainians back home to their families in the Ukraine.  You do know that if Putin conquers Ukraine that Putin is not going to stop there, and then we will have World War 3.  Putin is severely ticked off that certain countries sided with NATO, and those are the ones he will go after when he&#39;s done with Ukraine.Financial compensation in between Ukraine and whichever country helps them should be considered later.  President Zelinskyy was trying to point out that he didn&#39;t want his country to be obligated financially for the rest of their lives, which I will have to agree on.  President Trump is like a vulture that is trying to come in for the final kill.  Also, how do we know that Trump and Putin isn&#39;t in this thing together.  Putin conquers Ukraine, and then Russia and the USA divide the spoils of war between each other.  Think about it.

There was only one leader, one man who has earned admiration, one man who deserves respect in the Oval Office yesterday...and it wasn&#39;t an American. As Sen.

People don‚Äôt admire America just for its wealth, but for its diversity, freedom, and support for the weak. Trump seems to believe that without America, the world cannot survive, forgetting that many great nations existed long before it. In his time, he has undone a century of America‚Äôs legacy.

Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Zelinski blew it. He showed his true colours-1. He doesn‚Äôt listen to anyone but himself.2. He has no respect for America. 3. He just wants America to bend over backwards to make him look god4. Zelinski doesn‚Äôt care about Ukraine, nor the tens of thousands who will die as he makes his ridiculous demands from a foreign power who simply wants to broker a peace as quickly as possible.5. Why won‚Äôt Zelinski hold a democratic election to see what the people he claims to represent want?6. Let the EU get into bed with Zelinski and see how quickly the war escalates into a pan European war.7. God help us all for unless Ukraine gets a leader who has wisdom, Ukraine will be defeated. It is not a question of ‚Äúif Ukraine will be defeated‚Äù, but the question is now tragically, ‚Äúwhen‚Äù?
And JD, so aggressive, so unnecessary. Disgusting idiot.
How can you have a conversation with these goons. Vance and Trump are ridiculous. All this was unnecessary
Look at the expression on Zelensky&#39;s face from the very beginning of the meeting. Sometimes the face says more than the words
Thank you for uploading the full meeting. I appreciate it, because most media are very selective on which parts are shown to the public in many countries. President Zelensky deserves a full ovation for standing up for his country the way he did!
This journalist who asked about the suit must have half a brain, what a senseless idiot.
Absolutely not. Zelensky will wear a suit when the war ends. This is his vow. And it is necessary to pay attention. He is the President of the country that was attacked.
Vance is not a legitimate VP, i wanna see his birth certificate. Im pretty sure he was born in Russia.
This was super helpful, thanks!

This is what happens when people listen only to respond instead of to understand. Trumps an idiot and his ego got to him right here. Y&#39;all can have the mines if y&#39;all keep protecting them not a hard deal. Zelensky is saying what democracy because the Russians are going to do whatever they want..
Could it be that‚Ä¶:::2014  Problems begin in Ukraine. The President of the United States was Barack Obama.  :::2015  The Minsk II Agreements are signed between Ukraine, Russia, the OSCE, and pro-Russian separatists. These agreements would remain the main diplomatic framework for attempting to resolve the conflict in Donbas.  :::2017  <b>*January*</b> ‚Äì Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.  Over the next four years, Trump did nothing to enforce the agreements between Ukraine and Russia, in which:  - Russia accused Ukraine of not granting autonomy to separatist regions.  - Ukraine accused Russia of not withdrawing troops and support for the separatists.  - The ceasefire was constantly violated.  <b>*March*</b> ‚Äì Italy‚Äôs Northern League party, represented by Matteo Salvini, signed a cooperation agreement with United Russia, Vladimir Putin‚Äôs party. This raised discussions about the possible alignment of the League with Russian policies.  :::2018  <b>*October*</b> ‚Äì During a visit to Moscow, Gianluca Savoini, a close associate of Matteo Salvini, attended meetings with Russian officials to negotiate a possible financial deal for the League through discounts on oil supplies.  :::2019  Trump temporarily blocked military aid to Ukraine, a move that led to his first impeachment over the so-called ;Ukrainegate.;  <b>*December*</b> ‚Äì In Paris, a meeting was held between the leaders of Ukraine (Zelensky), Russia (Putin), Germany (Merkel), and France (Macron) to revive the Minsk negotiations.  The results were modest:  - A new ceasefire was agreed upon (which later failed).  - Further prisoner exchanges were planned.  - Zelensky requested control of the border with Russia before elections in the occupied territories, but Putin refused.  During Trump‚Äôs presidency, the U.S. maintained and expanded sanctions against Russia, but without pushing too hard to stop Moscow.  :::2020  <b>*July*</b> ‚Äì A new ceasefire agreement was signed between Ukraine and the Donbas separatists, with Russia‚Äôs support. For a few months, clashes decreased, but by the end of 2020, violations resumed.  At this point, a possible deal between Trump and Putin becomes evident: if Trump had won in 2020, he would likely have left Ukraine in Russia‚Äôs hands. If not, Putin had Trump‚Äôs approval to start a war that would weaken Biden and Europe‚Äîallowing Trump to return to office with the promise of ;ending it in 24 hours.;  :::2021  <b>*January*</b> ‚Äì Joe Biden is elected President of the United States.  :::2022  <b>*February*</b> ‚Äì Trump begins his propaganda, claiming that if he had been president, he would have ended the war in 24 hours.  Would the war have started with Trump? I don‚Äôt think so, because Trump and Putin had a shady agreement.  Biden and Europe had no choice but to rightfully try to contain Russia. Interestingly, Moscow did not use its usual strategy of bombing everything to the ground, as in past wars. Instead, the ;special operation; turned into a war of attrition, kept in a delicate balance‚Äîat least until a possible Trump return to the White House.  At this point, it becomes clear why Putin never truly sought peace in any of his statements‚Äîhe was waiting for someone: Trump.  <b>*September*</b> ‚Äì A report from the European Parliament highlights Russian interference with European parties, including Italy‚Äôs League, emphasizing their cooperation with the Russian regime.  A U.S. intelligence report reveals that since 2014, Russia has transferred over $300 million to political parties and candidates in more than 20 countries, including Europe, to influence elections and internal policies. While the report does not publicly list specific recipients, it exposes a Russian strategy aimed at supporting Kremlin-friendly movements.  :::2023  Trump continues his propaganda, claiming he can end the war in 24 hours.  :::2024  Trump continues his propaganda, claiming he can end the war in 24 hours.  <b>*October*</b> ‚Äì Spain‚Äôs right-wing Vox party seeks to strengthen its electoral position by aligning with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. This move raises questions about possible Russian influence, as Orb√°n recently met with Putin, openly challenging European institutions.  :::2025  <b>*January*</b> ‚Äì Trump is re-elected President of the United States.  Musk and Trump support European right-wing movements.  The outcome of the recent meeting with Zelensky is well known to everyone.  ### Conclusion  Could it be that Trump has betrayed the ideals of the American people, the European people, and democracies by making a reckless deal with Putin years ago?  Russia is reclaiming Eastern Europe, and Trump has returned to power in the U.S., leveraging the pressure Putin has exerted on the West since 2022.  Is the world heading toward a rise in fascism and Nazism?
None of the participants really had any skill in negotiating plus they used positional bargaining open this really needed principal negotiation. The constant subtle innuendos of insults that Trump kept making you can tell when he was by Zelenski face. Vance turned it on its head and allowed the floodgates of Trump&#39;s disdained
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
‚Å†‚Äã‚Å†Trump is trying to negotiate a peace deal. He made that clear in his opening dialogue. Trump was also complimentary to Ukraine and the bravery of its soldiers! Yet what‚Äôs was the first words Zelensky utters?‚Ä¶‚Äùwe will not negotiate and compromise with that (Putin) terrorist‚Äù Zelensky then asks for more money for weapons to fight the war..that Trump is trying to end! He wasn‚Äôt just referring to future security.

What does this have to do with Vincent, look at Zelensky&#39;s face from the very beginning
Vance. You are spinning the beginning and the end that has me bothered. As an American and proud supporter of our beautiful country, Zelenskyy is only speaking for his own. He said thank you multiple times within the first 5 minutes of this interview. Many Americans may never rewatch this to contradict your word. Yet, you‚Ä¶ a declared leader, dare threaten propaganda when you are only speaking your own propaganda. You should be ashamed. Trump backed you out of respect. You got 1 chance of backing from a fellow leader. Then you cut your chances of another backing. Be honest, be true, be humble, be kind. I‚Äôm appalled by how we treated our guest, President Zelenskyy. This interview reminded me of the movie, ‚ÄúThe Interview.‚Äù I understand the severity of what could have or was said in the interview. However, it could have been handled more professionally. You sir, Mr. Vance, need to reflect on reflective listening before you speak again.

Russia had been waiting since 2014 for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and did not attack anyone. Zelensky came to power in 2019‚Äîhe had three years to establish peace in Donbas. He ran for office with a promise of peace but deceived everyone. Before launching the special military operation, Russia asked the U.S. for security guarantees and for Ukraine not to join NATO, but these concerns were simply laughed at and ignored. Merkel and Hollande stated that the Minsk agreements were merely a trick to allow Ukraine to build up its military strength and were never intended to be fulfilled by Ukraine. The U.S. spent $5 billion on a coup in Ukraine in 2014. So who is the liar and aggressor here?
Very good, Mr. President Trump and the US Vice President and Secretary of State. Also good with Zelensky. The last 10 minutes started with the US Vice President saying that Zelensky was propagandizing against Russia, but he himself also campaigned for the American people of Pennsylvania to vote for Biden and not for Trump. Zelensky was a bit stubborn and despised the Vice President because of Zenleski&#39;s disrespectful criticism, and the most wrong thing was to argue with Trump to protect Ukraine. This is where they disagreed. But President Trump exposed the Biden administration&#39;s distortions and showed that this administration was very dirty when it slandered the computer containing business transactions with Ukraine at his son Hunter Biden&#39;s company Burismaz and blamed Putin for manipulating and sabotaging the US presidential election to cover up the crime of corruption and manipulation of US politics that Trump himself had to say out loud. In short, Trump must deal with the consequences of Biden causing Russia to attack Ukraine and Hamas to attack Israel on October 7, 2021, which is very tiring and not easy!

It‚Äôs sad that America allows retards like you to have an opinion and are allowed to voice it. You are so stupid. You should never open your mouth again.
Did the journalists actually bother to ask real useful questions such as where all the bllions of aid dissappeared in Ukraine? And this was admitted by Zelensky himself by the way that he has no clue where they went. I also wanna clearify something that Trump said about Europe getting their money back in form of a loan is not entirely correct. And its not a small contribution they have given either. According to many sources;The European Union (EU) and its member states have collectively provided substantial support to Ukraine, particularly since Russia‚Äôs invasion in 2022. As of early 2025, the EU reports having provided close to $145 billion (approximately ‚Ç¨134 billion) in total assistance, which includes financial, military, humanitarian, and refugee support. Of this, about 35% has been in the form of loans, while 65% has been grants or in-kind support. This indicates that while a significant portion of the aid is indeed loans, the majority is not repayable by Ukraine directly.;Notably, these loans are designed to be repaid using extraordinary profits from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, meaning Ukraine itself may not bear the repayment burden.;Which basically means that the ;loan; is basically gonna be paid back by frozen sanctioned assets of russia. Its a funny type of loan if u ask me ^_^
Students get arrested  for speaking out for Palestine and DJ Vance says ;we believe in free speech in this country;. A joke!ü§¨
;We&#39;ve got a lot of oil, a lot of gas, but we don&#39;t have RAW EARTH.;  With little effort, djt is uniquely comical.

My take on the Ukrainian war following the recent verbal clash at the White House between Trump and  ZelenskyDVance, Vice President of USA asked why Ukraine wasn&#39;t thanking the U.S. for billions in taxpayer-funded aid? Instead of thanking America, Zelensky snapped‚Äîwarning the U.S. doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand what‚Äôs coming.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs WHEN DonaldTrump cut him down: ;You don‚Äôt have the cards right now.; Trump was right. Zelenskyy has never had the cards. He isn‚Äôt some brave leader calling the shots. He‚Äôs a desperate man, clinging to power in a collapsing regime‚Äîpropped up by Western money, weapons &amp; propaganda.And with Ukraine losing the PR war &amp; real war, he&#39;s panickingUkraine wasn&#39;t an independent actor in this war. The real power brokers are in Washington, Brussels &amp; London, playing their geopolitical games.This war was engineered to weaken Russia. To understand that, you need to understand the history that they‚Äôll never tell you. Ukraine and Russia have been bound together for over 1,000 years. Kiev, Ukraine‚Äôs capital, once the heart of Kievan Rus‚Äîthe first great Slavic state‚Äîlaid the foundations for Russia itself. Ukraine‚Äôs very name means ;borderland;‚Äîwhich means the borderland of Russia. For centuries, it was an integral part of the Russian Empire, not some ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù nation. Even during the Soviet era, Ukraine wasn‚Äôt occupied‚Äîit was central to the USSR. Even Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was Ukrainian.When the USSR collapsed, Ukraine became independent and Washington stepped in‚Äînot to help Ukraine, but to weaponise it against Russia.The U.S. &amp; NATO lied to Gorbachev, promising they wouldn‚Äôt expand ‚Äúone inch eastward.; Yet NATO moved into Poland and the Baltic States. Ukraine was the ultimate NATO prize. The West poured billions into Ukraine‚Äîfunding pro-NATO political groups, NGOs &amp; media to manufacture an anti-Russian state.In 2004, the CIA backed the ;Orange Revolution,; overturning an election that favoured a pro-Russian candidate. The real coup came in 2014.Ukraine‚Äôs democratically elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, rejected an EU trade deal that would have destroyed Ukraine‚Äôs economy. That was unacceptable to Washington. So they removed him via a manufactured colour revolution. The so-called ;Maidan Revolution; wasn‚Äôt a grassroots movement. It was a CIA-backed coup‚Äîorchestrated by officials like @VictoriaNuland. So brazen was Washington, that Nuland was even caught on a leaked call, handpicking Ukraine‚Äôs next leader before Yanukovych was gone. The violent mobs that took over Kiev weren‚Äôt peaceful protesters. They were led by neo-Nazi groups like Azov Battalion‚Äîgroups that openly celebrate Nazi collaborators and wear SS insignia.These same groups now receive Western weapons. The post-coup regime then banned the Russian language‚Äîdirectly attacking millions of Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the east.That‚Äôs when Donbass &amp; Crimea said enough. Crimea held a referendum‚Äîover 90% voted to return to Russia. The Donbass also voted for independence. The people of the Donbass rejected Kiev‚Äîbut Kiev wouldn‚Äôt let them go. Instead, they launched a brutal war on their own people, shelling civilians for eight years. Where was the Western outrage? Nowhere! (Except at the start with this CNN story on the atrocities!) And what about @ZelenskyyUa? Who is he? Is he an organic leader who came from nowhere or was he installed?Covert Action reported that, in 2020, Zelenskyy secretly met with MI6 head Richard Moore. Why would a foreign president meet with the UK‚Äôs top spy instead of its PM? Is Zelenskyy a UK asset? According to reports, he is personally protected by British, not Ukrainian security. When he visited the Vatican, he snubbed the Pope and met with a British bishop. Guess who else was there? Richard Moore from MI6 again! That&#39;s some coincidence. Before politics, Zelenskyy was a comedian and actor‚Äîliterally playing the president on a TV show. Then, with the help of Western PR teams, fiction became reality.His campaign was funded by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, who owned Ukraine‚Äôs largest oil company and bank. Once in power, Zelenskyy‚Äôs priority wasn‚Äôt fighting corruption‚Äîit was making sure BlackRock &amp; Western banks took over Ukraine‚Äôs economy.Meanwhile, he funnelled millions into offshore accounts, and acquired a $34m mansion in Miami as well as a $3.8m London apartment. By 2022, NATO had armed Ukraine to the teeth, and Kiev had amassed forces near Donbass.Russia had a choice:‚ùå Let Donbass face ethnic cleansing‚ùå Let NATO turn Ukraine into a military base‚úÖ InterveneThey intervened, just as other nations would in those circumstances. The media screamed ‚Äúunprovoked invasion.‚Äù But NATO expansion, the 2014 coup, eight years of war on Donbass‚Äîthis war was provoked every step of the way.Ukraine was set up as a pawn. With Ukraine losing, Zelenskyy is being abandoned. DonaldTrump told him: ;You don‚Äôt have the cards.; And he‚Äôs right. This war was engineered. Ukraine needed Western intervention to win and that would mean WW3. It‚Äôs time the world wakes up to that reality. The war in Ukraine was deliberately provoked by the West. Zelenskyy is just another puppet‚Äîhis time is running out. And Trump? He knows. He wants peace‚Äînot another endless war.
So is Zelenskyy fighting on the front lines or something? Took off his holster and helmet before he walked in the White House?
President Trump knows the story already and he&#39;s not buying the cry of zelenski so he knows how to speak to him.
Ukraine&#39;s previous president had lots of negotiations with ruzzia in 2014 and 2015 and until Zelenskyy became president in 2019. Of course the information of what was negotiated (including whatever secret parts there were) was passed on to Zelenskyy when he came into office. And a lot was public knowledge anyway. Like, there were negotiations, there were press conferences at the end where a ceasefire was announced, then boom, next day ruzzians were shooting again. Zelenskyy knew about this before becoming president. He did political comedy, do you think he had no idea what was going on in the country? For a successful political comedy show you have a whole team of people who follow the news.
Zelenskyy was a freakn stand up comedian until the democrats in the USA installed him as president of Ukraine so they could set up several gain of function labs. As well as launder American tax payer money for democrats. That‚Äôs the entire reason the USA let this happen. To hide their crimes. Zelenskyy should NEVER have been allowed to run a burger stand let alone a country. And now he‚Äôs extremely rich and a hustler. PERIOD. I hope Trump takes every rare earth mineral they have to get the USA‚Äôs tax payers money back with a ton of interest. The entire staff of Obama and Biden should all be investigated and if found to be guilty of what we all know they‚Äôve done, be thrown in prison.
Trump is clearly trying to capitalize on this war. Someone that is on Ukraine‚Äôs side would not say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the middle‚Äù, ‚Äúboth sides have been hostile‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak badly about someone‚Äù. Absolutely degrading. This manchild didn‚Äôt surprise me, he just keeps getting me angry for the fact that he is so dangerous yet so powerful.

He mean to say this has happened before even after agreement and just want to know that&#39;s this wouldn&#39;t happen again, you the greatest country In the world start yelling at him people from the great authority, Well America isn&#39;t good and great  as I Heard üá≥üáµ
I love President Trump
lmfao these puppet who was made by the US into who and what he is at the moment is starting to act like he is a real sovereign leader of a powerful state. buddy should sit down before they snip his parachute strings and the russians end up delivering pizzas directly into his behind. What a circus this all is, the US already benefited greatly from the sacrifice of ukrainians and the death of russians. This puppet couldnt even figure out that if he promised not to join NATO no one would even have died of this war, but uh that&#39;s not the reason he was chosen for was it?
Pretty sad.
Yes well the people who aren‚Äôt doing their jobs typically lose that job. This wasn‚Äôt common under Biden‚Ä¶. Until Biden started having everyone who didn‚Äôt get vaccinated get fired. And depleted our military because they didn‚Äôt want to get vaccinated
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!

Our president and vice president are so stupid that they don‚Äôt even remember that they were already was a cease fire deal during the Trump administration that Putin broke and now they want another cease-fire deal and he‚Äôs asking what‚Äôs the difference when Putin doesn‚Äôt follow the laws of war why would we get a cease-fire deal when we already had one that he violated? Trump and JD are so retarded. They don‚Äôt know how to answer the question. They‚Äôre not smart enough to answer the question and they‚Äôre probably on Russia‚Äôs side Trump and JD support the invasion and the murder of children in Ukraine. They don‚Äôt want peace they want power. And it‚Äôs sad that the bullet missed Trump‚Äôs brain. Good thing is we only have 3 1/2 more years of these retards and he can never be president again. Unfortunately, the American public might be slightly stupider than our president and will vote for another retard when the time comes.
1. You care about a dude who hunts people on the street to throw them out to the frontlines against their will.2. You care about a dude who has nazi batallions in the army like Azov, Right Sector, Tornado etc3. You care about a dude who lied like 25 times in less than an hour and also broke multiple peace agreements with Russia like Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 4. You care about a dude who is illegitimate president of his country and HIGH AF without a suit on the most important meeting of his life and his country in US in front of a president.
Unbelievable
stop crying little girl
Trump , Musk ‚Äî DEPLORABLES  CLOWNS !!!!!
Hey Ukraine, how does it feel to have your leader look like a bitch in front of the world and show he doesn‚Äôt care about yall enough to have a ceasefire?
Trump is a ginger plague on America and, stupid, narcissistic demagogue, outlaw. He has no control what he says or what he does. All he has to do is flatter and and praise and curse Biden. Then he can be successfully to manipulate him. Which is what these Vences and Masks are doing.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
JD got anger problems
@ Exactly, this would‚Äôve gone better, had someone like Biden or even Obama been there. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt and now I guess we‚Äôll see what happens next with this.
The problem is JD Vance.

The utter disrespect towards zelensky while trump kisses putins ass is extremely off-putting. How does he plan on being a pioneer for a russian ukranian indefinite peace deal when he can&#39;t even find peace in himself to have a respectful conversation with the president of the victim in this whole ordeal. All this man sees is money.
Now that&#39;s what the democracy is! we need this kinda politics, clear and cut and fully transparent. Loved it really.

You can visit Ukraine and live 3 years in Kharkov.
A man who has already taken sides in a war, is more interested in what he can get out of the war torn country, insulting his predecessors, and  then minimizing the destruction of a Nation and its people is NOT someone who should be a President of anything, let alone a Country.  He&#39;s a disgrace, an embarrassment, and an absolutely deplorable human being.  Shame on you!!!

@@UnBroken11100 Ukraine is not in a position to believe or disbelieve Trump, he tried to convey this all the time, but Zelensky is out of touch with reality
He didn‚Äôt? Tf is wrong with you, he said he‚Äôs aligning with the people who need to come to an agreement because if he only takes one side then he can‚Äôt be the mediator
Do you think Americans will follow his order to attack EU?
Yep, should‚Äôve never been there
Vance was hostile towards Zelenskyy and then the whole deal went off the rails.
Why is Zelenskyy bad mouthing the person he‚Äôs trying to make a deal with lmao then asking us for more money and weapons bc if we don‚Äôt give it to him our men are gonna fight a war. Get real, Zelenskyy wants more from us and he doesn‚Äôt like hearing no
Zelenskyy said costume but meant suit. The Ukrainian word for suit sounds just like the English word costume. And Zelenskyy has mixed up that word in previous interviews.
All I can say is this ,I found out information from a real source .That the Russians were killing civilians digging mass graves and stealing thousands of children and putting them in Russia .Sure enough Zelensky is showing Trump pictures of torture and mass graves and he says they took thousands of children .To me sounds scary this isn&#39;t good Zelensky will never concede to Putin as long as they are taking children That&#39;s going to far man .We don&#39;t know the truth about what going on in that war .What role does the CIA play in that war It&#39;s got CIA written all over it do they know where all the money went ? All I know This Isn&#39;t good üòÆooh shit
Guys, this is much funnier than some comedy movies.
world war three??? Who;s side will you be on Donald???
What kind of diplomacy are you talking about??
üòÇ
that&#39;s how deeply fd your brain is, Trump said 100 times he wants peace and ppl to stop dying and your conclusion - Trump is embarrasing. That&#39;s how you know you&#39;re not a smart or good human being.
Will the EU step up and put their money where their mouth is? Or does the EU expect the USA to continue to fund the war with US taxpayers money and to supply Ukraine with astonishing amounts of modern weaponry? Perhaps the EU wants the US to provide hundreds of thousands of soldiers to do the job the combine EU countries should have done three years ago?
I&#39;ve reported you. Cos bullying is no-no.
How disgraceful for Trump andVance to treat president of Ukraine. The president of Ukraine just wants the security of his people to be safe and all the prisoners that Russia has to be released. What‚Äôs wrong with that before signing anything? Would you sign on the dotted line without all the facts?
Zelensky doesn‚Äôt really want the war to end. I suspect zelensky is making some money from the USD 350 billions . Could this be why he doesn‚Äôt want to end the war? He mentioned Russia lost 700,000 soldiers, but didn‚Äôt say how many Ukrainian soldiers died. Trump doesn‚Äôt want more young men to die from both sides.
he‚Äôs getting them from the news cast that are in ukraine and from russia. however i can 100% tell you those were not all just ukrainians. russian soldiers are also getting beat up mocked tortured and then killed. both sides are doing this it‚Äôs not just one and that what has always bothered me about zelensky when  he talks about ukraine it‚Äôs always russia is doing this russia did that when no one actually looks at why everything even happened. did you guys even know that the war has actually been going on for 20 years? no america doesn‚Äôt because no one wants to see that. once soviet union broke the ukrainian leaders have tortured our civilians for many years. both russia and ukraine are in the wrong and i think that‚Äôs important to see
Does Trump not?
Europe is running into the warm embrace of the peoples Republic of China. It&#39;ll just be a matter of time they come screaming for us to save them. They&#39;re screaming for help now because of Russia. Clearly Zelensky and Europe don&#39;t want a cease fire because the facts are they cannot win this war, they need us and our weapons to even stay in it so instead of throwing away money and lives it&#39;s time to negotiate peace. Europeans and Zelensky cannot accept the truth.
This was super helpful, thanks!

Zelensky doesn&#39;t want a cease fire. Just wants more money being brought in and more weapons.
Trump and Vance pissed into the wind, and deserve the blow-back.
He asked for 350 bn, when in total only 119.7 bn were given by US. And the biggest part of it was given as grants by the Congress and state institutes, not as loans according BBC reports. So what right does a new president have to demand any resources from Ukraine without suing the Congress over previous agreement stipulations that he doesn&#39;t like? Trump makes USA look as a untrustworthy partner and as a mobster.
Because of USA will start the 3rd world war, as Zelensky said‚Ä¶Russians do not have word, they don‚Äôt care about agreements‚Ä¶ keep in mind american people, you took the wrong decision when you voted Trump‚Ä¶

When your pride is stake and open statements are made indicating that zel and ukrine is literally dependant on USA (which I agree is true), u tend to justify yourself.

QUIZ :  What country was an ally of the United States during WW ll ? What country suffered the most loss ? What country did the United States president agree to make sure they got reparations, and what happend to that president ? That president died in office (natural causes ?? )and the country talked about got no support from its ally, the United States. So what terratory was one of the reparations ? Hmmm      I bet you can figure it out, if not, look up Ukraine and take a simple look at a world map before and after that war (as stated in a different comment).
Make salo. Lol.
Ur alignment is with peace.. go ahead.. God bless u
How many times did Trump say we were going to ;TAKE; rare Earth materials from them? We won&#39;t be giving our large supplies of gas or oil, won&#39;t need to provide military security. The security will be from American companies ;DIGGING; those rare Earth minerals (on the east side of Ukraine right next to our good ol&#39; pal), not military security. We won&#39;t need it with this deal. Putin has broken other deals, but not one of Trump&#39;s. A cheater won&#39;t ever cheat again people!!!Until they get caught again....
That would take insight, empathy and understanding ~things they lack...
He tired. He listen what Russian TV says from Vance.
USAID paid actors millions to go to Ukraine to take photos with Zelensky. Is that what you wanted?
Trump-all in for a profit-or let Putin destroy Ukraine. MAGA or make Trump richer again.?
To make claims that after this deal everything will be over and that this will never happen again is ridiculous. You are dealing with Russia. They‚Äôre not going away. Putins ways are not going to just go away.
Protection for Raw Earth!!!
We&#39;ve never had so many people lose their jobs during the first 30 days of a president taking office!
China vs India is really hard conflict. Check geography.
The reason this meeting went astray is because they didn&#39;t like the negative things he said about Putin. The reporter asking a question about his clothing was ridiculous.

I&#39;m surprised Zelensky did not walk. This matter was not taken seriously, Zelenskies remark about wearing a costume later spoke volumes. He was obviously trying to redirect the conversation back to solving the issue at hand while Trump used this platform to continue to blame Biden who is no longer part of anything going on once Trump took office and to tout how wonderful he ;Trump; is. It is painful to watch
and also thanks to whoever&#39;s idea it was to record this and make it public, it could be behind closed doors.
what a disaster. pitiful.
He wants to bloviate and appear relevant. Trump should have kept him in the kitchen where he belongs because he clearly doesn&#39;t have the stuff to be a real diplomat.
First of all, Trump doesn&#39;t speak to Zelenskyy at all, he doesn&#39;t even look at him. He is just giving a speach of selfpromotion. At the other side, Zelenskyy is trying to catch his eyes while Trump is speaking and when he starts to speak, he is looking at Trump, not to jurnalists.That shows something about respect and disrespect too.
@@piratesmvp Yes, he had a choice.  If Trump were decent, he would have called out his lap-dog then and there.  Zelensky had been profusely thankful to the US up to that point and Vance didn&#39;t care to notice.  Trump decided to back up Vance over Zelensky.Now, Putin has the opportunity to say Trump is not in control of his dog to correct him when clearly wrong and out of line; that Trump is not ;strong; and only protects those who yap in his favor.  Oh, golly gee.  It&#39;s just like anything could be spun in the direction one chooses.

@@AlterEgo-13he didn&#39;t even pretend to be on Zelensky&#39;s side, he openly put the equity sign between him and the aggressor.
@@piratesmvp Vance&#39;s reaction was totally retaliatory for Zelensky schooling him on the history and reality of the war which he clearly did not understand other than what he ;saw on TV;. Rather than be schooled on national television, Vance dug in and made himself look even worse with the aggressive finger pointing and emotional voice. Unfortunately Trump let himself get pulled into that childish exchange and lose focus on the ;deal; (whatever that was). I don&#39;t think Trump wanted to take it there, but he probably was repressing a lot of his anger during the whole meeting when Zelensky repeatedly contradicted him. Maybe not good etiquette or diplomacy to contradict someone you&#39;re trying to make a deal with numerous times on national television, but hey, facts are facts. I always thought of Zelensky as a beggar and am totally against throwing good money after bad in Ukraine (and more lives lost) but I kinda have more respect for him now after seeing him staying as composed as he did in such a hostile place.

That‚Äôs the problem with todays world.

No one wants war. If you are a small country u need to be self aware about ur capabilities and have to be diplomatic how you main relationship with other countries.Just like India and China shares border, but India never challenged china for anything.No matter how much we mock these leaders, they have huge responsibilities on their shoulder.Trump is right when he says u are gambling, yes zelensky is gambling and he doesn‚Äôt have anything in his favour.

Wow, watch the full meeting and it helps you get a good perspective of the situation.  Thank you for posting the full meeting.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
So a simple thank you is gratitude enough for Weapons and $350 billion of our hard earned money, then turning around acting like this and calling our VP a bitch. Do you realize how stupid you sound?

This is why the world should abandon USA under Right Wing Dark state, and no longer recognise USD status as global currency.The world will pivot to China, bye MAGA Dark state swamp. Dump USD reserves, buy CNY.

I cant belive USA selected this fool twice..how stupid are you? USA: yes
So?
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
JD needs to STFU.  Dude you just got in office.  President Zelensky has been President longer than you have been in politics.  Like Zelensky said, ;Have you ever been, why don&#39;t come once!;... JD said, ;I&#39;ve see pictures;... Dude STFU.  And disrespecting other US presidents was also disrespectful. And the truth is that this big boy attitude is only towards a country struggling with war.  That would not pop this crap to China or North Korea. Trump would be scrambling to make the deal.
Zelensky is a con man whos taken the US for more than 150 billion. Dude got put in his place. You&#39;re in a war you cannot win without military aid from us negotiations for peace will happen and throwing away money and lives will end.
JD: ;I know about situation in Ukraine because read stories;. It was rude. Imagine you hear this from police as reason to not visit place and gather evidences.

Trump is Putin&#39;s puppet
To whom this may concern, I Janice Marie is fighting for freedom and I am asking for help
Zelensky please bring a pencil next time. A very sharp pencil.
At this point, Zelensky has better chance for peace by befriended with China. Trump is Putin&#39;s side chick. üòÇAsk China to be negotiator with Russia.
JD VANCE created that argument! I don&#39;t think I like him at all.
I blame vance for the outburst between the two presidents
We all ukrainians are very thankful to USA for help, I agreed that Europe didn&#39;t help much, only Poland did help, but putin is very cunning person we need guarantees to protect our country.  üò¢
This video makes it very obvious how Trump and Vance treat anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with them.  They try to shut them down by shouting over-top of anyone.  They don&#39;t even have the common respect to let Zelensky answer the questions.  I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;m NOT American!  Trump and Vance are just bullies!
Towards the end of the meeting President Trumps face looked like he was about to have a stroke.  Vance ignited this whole mess with his comments about. Zelensky being ungrateful.
F this guy, $350 billion and this POS acts like this. F him and the fact that our hard earned money goes to this kind of bullshit! Calls our VP a Bitch and then acts like we owe him something. I&#39;m tired of being taken advantage of.
Was your home part or a western intel coup where you took your home from another person? And now your home is  now being used as a launchpad to attach the invader&#39;s property? Look up the recent history that happened in 2014 to see where this thing started...look to 30 years ago where the US said it would not go east of Berlin and lied to Russia about it since then. Wake up.
@@cimbakahn Yeah I meant at the top where you said ;they just truly wanted to help Ukraine;. I&#39;m sure they do <i>want</i> to, but they couldn&#39;t justify this level of aid without that domestic or future security consideration
Being thankful is not asking asking asking, and then a simple thank you. They have valuable assets, pay back the American tax payers, or else. I like that message ! Otherwise the taxpayers money is just gone, with nothing in return. That is taxation without representation, which actually is what already happened, and this is a way to make it right. The big deal here with the ;thanks; is making this right with all of us taxpayers here in the US.... or else... stop the wasted money. We gain nothing from this otherwise. The only thing it will do if the United States keeps going is weakening this Nation.

How can Trump talk without even swallowing his Saliva?üòÇü§î
Ts pmoüíî
I think that America was founded on Christian values and on Jesus Christ and when we give HIM honor in our nation and give HIM the glory He will take care of our country. I think other countries who wish to be free should place their faith and trust in Jesus Christ - He would defend their countries too. Its actually very simple to end all wars in the world is if the leader would trust God and ask their people to trust God then their nation will be blessed. PSALM 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. (THIS IS SPEAKING ABOUT ISRAEL, BUT IT CAN PERTAIN TO ANY NATION WHO GIVES HIM HONOR) It&#39;s simple - the hard part is to place a leader in office for a country who trusts in HIM and HIM alone for God to bless them.
Zelensky said it this is not an American and Russian war this is the Ukraine and Russian war they don&#39;t need nothing from us everybody&#39;s saying Trump and Putin are buddies if that was true Trump wouldn&#39;t do anything and let Putin Crush Ukraine and then Putin just give him the minerals he wants I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m arguing with a parrot though
What is up with trumps body language
Trump is an idiot! We are with Zelensky!!! Trump is a dumb douchebag!!!!!!
Zelenski what a stupid guy,oh my god,he send Ukrainians to death and now his comfortable in this deal?What a monkey
Completely agree. SSR provided lands and opportunity to be a separate country. Only one point asked: be friend.   No, Ukraine has so bad memory. They decided to hate Russia id good idea. Ok, Russia after that returned back lands.  After that US supported Ukr in the war. But Ukraine asks so much, each day they need more and more and already blamed USA supporting not enough. What‚Äôs wrong  with your memory Ukraine?
Great job, this video was very useful!

Whats  the vice-president talking about zalinskey out of line?   President Trump arranged the meeting with the news media there so the whole world could here whats going on with the conflict. Zalinskey said what he had to say regarding Pugins history with the conflict.  He never lives up to the agreements.
JD&#39;s words about stories call facepalm.

Trump is a moron, I hope people Understand it is the business community he let down. Not giving them an inside track on investments in Ukraine. Because the allies of Ukraine as soon as they are done playing around, and just thiniing the horde of Russia. Is going due to rip the fucking bandage of of naked horsie Putin‚Äôs misadventures and going to be the talk of the world stage. David and his stones in the weapons placed to Ukraine‚Äôs hands is going to fall a Goliath that has menaced histories its neighbors and its very people in its terror and archaic way of government pre enlightenment. Its well time to rip the bandage off and rewrite the world in a defeat for its people rather then its power, and from there who knows what momentum their is to gain, in the ongoing march for a more inclusive power.

It was Zelenskyy that changed it with his attack on the VP. When he mentioned him by name ;what diplomacy are you talking about JD?; Meanwhile the VP always addressed him as ;Mr President;. Zelenskyy is a bufoon. He is not a statesman. And his deficiencies have been revealed in front of the public here.
;Why don&#39;t you wear a suit, disrespectful;Anti-Woke ppl are the snowflake Karen that trigger by tiny stuff ü§°
That means Putin does not care about Trump&#39;s meetings, solutions.
Raw Earth? Trump doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s saying. I&#39;ve head him say ;Rare Earth; too. Normally ;rare earths; are plural because you got your Cerium, your Gadolinium, your Erbium, and who could forget Neodymion &#39;cuz its so hard to pronounce and so useful in magnets.

When you see the full picture it is clear that Trump is trying for peace while zelensky is angry but he needs to show respect to people who helped him and now trying to bring peace.

Maybe the reason of misunderstood was a mentality difference, that UA has very strong and direct thinking and that was not a first language of President of UA - maybe his words were not properly interpreted during the visit to the White House. It should be a professional translator between them. The problem was that Zelensky told that Putin broke cease-fire in 2019 while Trump was a president and he was doing nothing with it and it angered and escalated the conflict with Trump and Vance - that was a language barrier misunderstanding. Nevertheless, president of US should not talk like that to this to other president and his guest.
Zelenskyy didn&#39;t attack Vance! It was the other way around! He just responded to Vances diplomacy bullshit because he has sayed multiple times that Putin can&#39;t be trusted. His word,  signature is worthless!How would you react in his shoes?! ;Oh, thank you, gracefully, your kindness, i would have never thought of signing a wothless peace of paper! That means so much to me! I will allways be in your debt!;

The criminals wear the suits. That and solidarity with the victims of his people in Ukraine are reason enough not to wear a suit until the war is over.Clothes don&#39;t make the man and don&#39;t make a bad character better, Trump and Putin have confirmed that for decades.Vance, like Trump, is ruthless and knows neither humanity nor compassion nor fairness. You should ask Trump and Vance whether they would give a burglar who killed their family the house in which they lived until they were murdered by the criminals.Vance, like Trump, is ruthless and knows neither humanity nor compassion nor fairness.

I am ashamed to be an American. I was always taught, your word is who you are. If you make promises, you keep them.

It was shocking to see two most powerful world leaders being unable to find common ground in life or death situation for Ukrainian people.I understand the feelings of Volodymyr Zelensky, who&#39;s commoners are perishing in the ground and who is forced to depend on major powers to prevent his home being destroyed.I also get <a ="http:/results?search_query=%23potus">#POTUS who is trying his best to solve by far the most important and difficult question and who also has only one chance to succeed with his World Peace Plan.I also see how vice president JD Vance could have misunderstood Ukrainian president who has clearly been under the significant pressure of being a guest in the foreign house who is forced to ask for help.I only hope to see mister Zelensky wear his costume again ‚úä

Does JD Vance not understand that there are military drafts of civilians to become soldiers during times of war? That is not a new thing. Of course, Ukraine might have to do that. Especially after being invaded and after many years of war.
While Trump and his admins afraid Russia they can&#39;t help, they can&#39;t help even US.
This press conference is beyond proof that Trump is not qualified nor capable of handling extreme situations that call for a professional to handle. He should be giving financial advice and trying harder to come up with a serious solution instead of constantly repeating himself. He&#39;s just upset that Zelenskyy knows better how to handle the situation so Trump belittles Zelenskyy due to it embarrassing Trump and in order to get Ukraine the help it needs Zelenskyy is supposed to just sit and take it. No, Trump did not help at all nor is he qualified to be a President without a team backing him up.
@ I watched the whole thing and I saw a man who is in total denial that he‚Äôs lost the war for his country coming to United States asking for help from the Trump administration not listening to the advice given to him by us and being dismissive. If he&#39;s not going to accept the terms of the ceasefire then why did he waste everyone&#39;s time by not signing the deal. Instead he‚Äôs just complaining. He has no other options. United States isn&#39;t going to give him more money for nothing in return and no we aren&#39;t going to escalate Zelenskyy‚Äôs war for him. Beggars can&#39;t be choosers. Clown.
The amount of Democrat Bots in the comment section is astonishing. üòÇ
Before you comment ignorantly, you need to understand what led up to this war. Take a good look at a world map before WW ll . To comment without understanding all that has gone into this from that point FOREWARD is like reading a book starting and ending in the last  few pages of the last chapter. Ukraine got themselves into this mess, there is no two ways about that. I personally do not agree with our US tax dollars being spent for Ukraine.... seems that would be taxation without representation. How is this bennifiting the US taxpayer, and dont tell me we need Ukraine to survive as a nation, it is only weakening this country monetarily, and we should be spending that money (tax payer) on other important things here and not depleting our weapons stockpile.

The administration invites Zelensky to the White House, meeting was productive and went well enough until JD derailed it with his pouting about not being thanked during the meeting. He should have just kept his mouth SHUT
Both Vance and Trump showed incredible loyalty for their presidents!
Minutes of the meeting :üîµTrump wants to be the middleman and do the negotiationsüîµZelenskyy says Putin cannot be trusted as he has proved repeatedly (25 times) that he breaks the ceasefire deals. Hence Zelenskyy needs security guarantee. He is also ready to give access to America for the rare earth mineral mining in exchange.üîµ Trump, being the narcissist that he is, does not want to accept that his strategy of doing negotiations may not work and that security guarantee may be a must.üîµ Trump thinks Zelenskyy is ungrateful for the help he has been offered and repeatedly expresses it via his team. He openly bullies the Ukrainian president for the same.
Why does Ukraine exist in the first place?
Z wants guarantees because Putin hasn‚Äôt kept his agreements. What Z isn‚Äôt realizing is that if Trump and Putin have an alliance, Putin May actually - potentially- keep his cease fire‚Ä¶. It seems like Putin does actually respect Trump‚Ä¶ fingers crossed that their egos soothe each other enough to keep us out of WW3. Jesus Christ is the only peacemaker who will bring peace to all of this. Praying for his presence between all politicians
Ukraine should THANK the US. They should THANK them by letting them take $500bn of rare earth metals.The US should go after the Zionists for recompense. They&#39;re the ones who started this whole thing. And, they&#39;re the ones who have all their gold.

America always defined manipulation and Evil through years and history .. one day America has to face consequences
Trump asked for access to rare Earth minerals in return. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unreasonable given all of the billions of dollars and military equipment we&#39;ve given them already. Zelensky wants to take and give nothing in return and tries to grab more attempting to use that as leverage. It&#39;s selfish and unappreciative. He is ultimately biting the hand which feeds him.

Not sure what Vance was doing there or even why the press was allowed to persecute man rape like that on the prime minister of another nation. Sure we all have ideas on trump ;hair; and Vance lack of intelligence butt they seemed to have gone in to rape President Zelensky for no reason.Not sure why the ;reporter; was allowed to attend so close for filming butt the blue suit reminded me of the guy that starred in ;the mask; and Vance was the mindless dog that ended up with the mask.Trump needs to figure who is friend and who just sees a clown running  for the anals of history.
If you care about suit. Ask Roosevelt about suit in 1943-44.
JD took this to another level. Zelenskyy has the right to be concerned and want a guarantee but Trump thinks his word should be enough. Too much macho behaviour and egos. Next time you meet leave JD out the room as Trump was doing ok until bully boy came in.
When you come with a deal to give us 1 dollar, but ask for 10 dollars and call our rigthful president a dictator, you should expect a wakeup slap. Be grateful that we don&#39;t take you to the court and show how much clowning is your deals and words.
I didn&#39;t expect Vance to play dirty. He should have kept it simple and not that proud. He was feeling entitled.
Heard so much about this meeting. Thank you for posting.
Talk about an ambush. Look out Zelenskyy,  Vance is attacking on your left flank..

Who the fck ask for suit ? Very inappropriate and unprofessional
The man asking the question about the suit is MTG&#39;s lowlife boyfriend. He&#39;s not a journalist. This should tell you something about what type of people Trump allows in the Oval Office. I believe a Russian media outlet was let in as well. Meanwhile he kicks out the AP. SMH
Zelensky is placed in very disrespectful situation situation
Honestly, I‚Äôm not a fan of the current administration but Zelensky really escalated this by challenging the VP in front of the media about the efficacy of diplomacy. Zelensky clearly was unhappy with the situation from the beginning which is understandable as the USA is making this sound like it‚Äôs a two sides situation when it is an occupation.
May be this Vance provoke to many President who invited by Trump üòî since we can‚Äôt see the all meetings.

Zelensky was instructed by British gov.and MI-6 not to sign this agreement, because Britain has already signed a secret agreement with Ukraine about their minerals, factories, Odessa city. And EU + American democrats wanted to screw this meeting, to create Anti-Trump coalition. Zelensky just did what they told.

Trump didn&#39;t have a choice but to go along with Vance after he had that reaction to Zelensky. If he had not done so, Putin would be saying that the US administration is divided, weak, and therefore incapable of arbitrating peace negotiations between the two countries. That would be just the excuse he needs to continue the war. At least now, there is still opportunity to reset discussions with Ukraine.

Does nobody remember all the video game footage they used to convince us of that war? Does anyone remember the hospital they said was bombed and come to find out it was in an abandoned village?  What about the nurse they filmed at that hospital then used her again in more false footage later to see her holding a sign behind news lady saying sorry I took part in the kremlin propaganda. !  Does anyone remember the news broadcast live filming all the dead bodies from the war and the wind came up and blew a body bag off one guy and he woke from the dead to put the bag back over his head? Why is Trump going along with the BS we all know is there?

Peace talks doesn&#39;t mean not taking any responsibility for crimes done against humanity.

@@daystar3172 No he won‚Äôt. You lot are so biased I‚Äôd be surprised if you knew which way your own a rse is pointing! No, I‚Äôm not from the US of A‚Ä¶
@ yet he spoke too much, to put it mildly
Poor, poor Zelya. I wonder, when got out of White House, did he have a dusty footprint on his behind?
You Americans are strange, you only need shock value and show. I read the comments and I am very shocked that you write in pine; this dialogue will remain in history, they will write about it in books or film it in movies. You only paid attention to HOW the conversation went, rather than to hear WHAT the conversation was about. Trump only said what his voters want to hear!!!! It is very important for him to be president for at least 2 consecutive election terms. If he does not hold his post for the next period, he will then be far behind Putin, and it is important for him to match. So let&#39;s remember Trump&#39;s phrases: ;If I were the US president then, I would never have allowed the war to start.; An empty but loud phrase that does not carry any evidence that this would not have really happened if he were in power in the US. Well, logically, he would not have been able to do anything just like any other US president, because it depended only on Putin and Zelensky.  The next phrase: ;We gave you more money than Europe; A phrase that plays on such a feeling as greed. To make Americans think that this money is from their wallets. This is despite the fact that Trump first talked about 100 billion, then 200 billion and now already 500 billion $. He said that it went from taxpayers&#39; money, but this is a lie. This money is actually from the state reserve. The US state reserve has been collected for hundreds of years in the form of gold reserves, oil reserves, precious stones, etc. Let me remind you that the USA ranks 1st in the world&#39;s gold reserves, far ahead of Germany, which ranks 2nd. So, the US has a total of reserves and resources hundreds of times greater than the country&#39;s GDP and this is sixtillions of dollars. Dear US citizens, believe me, not you, not your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, no one will use at least $50,000 from this reserve, even if you die of hunger.  You still worry about $500 billion. This is of course your business, but I would not worry about money that will never fall into YOUR hands, at least 0.00000000000001% of the US reserve. But your president knows that he can shoot ;blanks; and kill his listener. The next phrase: ;Putin respects me; Now that&#39;s a red light. Let&#39;s be adequate. Putin is much smarter than Trump and can outsmart him in no time. We can simply judge this by the fact that Putin has been in power for 25 years continuously, Trump thinks that if he is lucky enough to be in power for the second time, then at least he can try to negotiate with Putin. But ambitions are one thing and reality is completely different. Which is something Trump very often does not understand. So for Putin, this is a sweet bun that cooked itself and presented on a platter. What else does he need to tell him in this case?  I respect you not just as a president, but as a person and a lot of other flattery to win you over. Did Putin manage to win Trump over? 100% and we found out from the phrase: ;Putin respects me.; So, stage 1, win him over so that the course of the war changes in his favor, when it will be necessary to compromise on the part of Russia, then Putin will eat his bun. Thus, not only Ukraine will hate Trump, but also all of Europe. They will hate not only Trump, but unfortunately the United States, because you elected such a president. The United States is the daughter of Europe, I will be very offended if there is a conflict between us because you have a feeble-minded but ambitious president in power. I also know many Americans who say: Trump and Vance wanted to disgrace Zelensky at this meeting, but ended up disgracing themselves.  I am very grateful to these people and while you exist, these people who have a different opinion, who are worried about their country and its future, then the US still has a chance. A very good movie for the evening for Putin, his conversation with Trump alone caused so much noise, this is exactly how Trump dances to Putin&#39;s tune, he will not notice soon, perhaps in a few years, but then it will be too late to agree!

This is the same Vladimir Zelensky who recognized in March 2022 that some Western states including USA wanted to use Ukraine as a proxy against Russia:-  ‚ÄúThere are those in the West who don‚Äôt mind a long war because it would mean exhausting Russia, even if this means the demise of Ukraine and comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives.‚Äù  Both Israeli and Turkish mediators have confirmed that the U.S. and U.K. sabotaged the Istanbul peace agreement in order to pit Russia against the Ukrainians in a proxy war. After the Maidan coup by the US in 2014, Ukrainian army began shelling ethnic Russians in Donbas. It subsided after Minsk agreements in 2014/15, but as disclosed by Poroshenko in June ‚Äò22, and by Merkel &amp; Hollande in Dec ‚Äò22, the Minsk were intended to buy time to arm Ukraine against Russia, not to seek peace. The US occupied Afghanistan for 20 years, but it finally left in Aug ‚Äò21, evidently to prepare for the Ukraine project 6 months later. In Sep ‚Äò21 Zelensky visited Biden to get support to join NATO, and shelling in Donbas by Ukrainian forces up 2800% since 16 Feb ‚Äò22 (OSCE data), crossing Putin‚Äôs redlines and provoked the war.This is the same Zelenskyy who failed to understand that his countrymen refused to fight for him or for their country. Huge amounts of young Ukrainian men roaming around in USA and Europe. They even get to travel home to Ukraine for holidays whilst still getting welfare payments from our government. Meanwhile in USA elderly and disabled veterans being thrown out of their homes to make room for illegal immigrants. U.S city streets are lined with hundreds of thousands tents, shelters, homelessness and drug addiction taking over. Cost of living soaring from inflation, making it impossible for families to provide basic needs.My niece lives in Canada. My niece bought some car cleaning products from a gas station and when she asked about sales associate accent, he replied that he is from Ukraine. My niece asked why he wasn&#39;t fighting for his homeland since Canadian soldiers (and other NATO nations) were fighting for his country. He replied that NATO promised to defend Ukraine and he wanted to be safe! He doesn‚Äôt want to fight and die. Unbelievable! Ukraine is number one corrupt country in Europe and 4th in the world, Biden funded 350 billions of taxpayers dollar to Ukraine like Amazon Prime customer ( Free shipping of U.S dollar ). Biden- Kamala Corruption in USA was like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. Under Trump presidency those days will be over soon‚Ä¶very soon! A deal needs to be made. It won‚Äôt be a good one for deep state, but the longer Ukraine waits, the worse the deal is likely to become.The Soviet Union gifted land to the Ukrainian SSR, in good faith, along with Crimea and the Black Sea fleet. On condition they always stay together. The contingency was broken, and Russia reclaimed. So ;Putin invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, after demanding that NATO abandon membership for Ukraine and pull back the alliance&#39;s troops on NATO&#39;s eastern flank -- actions rejected by the West.;  A peace agreement resulting from talks in Istanbul in April 2022 would have resulted no territorial changes, only security guarantees of Ukraine&#39;s neutrality and assurance of Ukraine never joining NATO.  Boris Johnson convinced Zelenskyy to reject the agreement, but as the leader of Ukraine, Zelenskyy is ultimately to be held accountable for not accepting the agreement.  None of the territorial concessions that are being talked about now would have happened if Zelenskyy would have just accepted the agreement. A deal needs to be made. It won‚Äôt be a good one for deep state, but the longer Ukraine waits, the worse the deal is likely to become.Spineless Dictator Zelenskyy picked a wrong fight with U.S President Trump! He will pay a big price! His US visa will be revoked forever and every property he owns in US will be seized by the US government. DOGE should investigate how and where he spent over $350 billion dollar! He will have to answer to the US taxpayers! He may face criminal charges for stealing money if proven guilty by US Justice Department. All European leaders should be on alert whoever behind this proxy war!!!
With all respect to Zelensky and Ukraine, Trump wanted to make peace and get a deal which help to align interests of USA with interests of Ukraine (the economic value of the deal is negative for USA, but it&#39;s good for Ukraine), and Zelensky with the first words of his speech wanted to continue to tell the same words about Putin and factually used the Oval Office media for insulting his Russian opponent. Why the hell anybody allows himself to destroy all peaceful efforts for a minute of world attention? Is there any new words for anybody - in these Zelensky&#39;s words? Does anybody in the world not know the Zelensky&#39;s position about Russian president? U went to Oval Office to work on peace and on a deal to help your country and instead of this u are doing the same old stuff just to destroy all Trump&#39;s efforts to make peace. The only reason for that type of behavior - Zelensky wanted to do it, to make him popular in Ukraine again and doesn&#39;t want to make peace, because that peace deal will finish his power in Ukraine. That&#39;s really sad. Hope USA and Ukraine will be able to find common ground in the next  3-5 months - if not, that will be much more devastating loss of human lives.

I am glad ppl are not against zelensky here. I mean am not a fan or abything. But he said nothing wrong.
jd vance is on his shit no lie. very smart very well spoken and very direct in what hes saying. just wow to jd vance good job man. especially coming from hard youth. you can become anything you dream of.
I can&#39;t say anything else than what has been said in these comments. But when a family man, a leader of his people, a defender of his country gets put down by a so-called leader of a great and powerful nation, is totally disgusting. Slava Zelensky.

Reporter: gives hollow praises to TrumpTrump:  ;I LOVE THIS GUY!  Who are you with?;Reporter: <b>answers</b>Trump: ;I like them!  I like the question!;Trump then states ;there never should have been no war; and lies about Iran being broke and Hezbollah going from ;no money to $300million in a period of 4 years [under Biden];
Trump and his vice think that&#39;s the way to start a peace building? They are totally wrong. Shouting what they want to listen.
Don&#39;t be fooled
Russian word ;suka; Russians use to drop emotions. Suka is different with mothefcker. The most cases ;suka; uses to drop stress when person has tired mental.
If we watch the entire video,  we can clearly see that Zelensky had no intention of signing the deal from the beginning.He had already given up on U.S. aid and wanted to deliberately provoke the U.S. to break the deal in order to extract aid from Europe instead.
Wtf is raw earth
I frankly wish Trump will ever support Ukraine to protect freedom, democracy for the world especially for EU and US power effectively .
It seems that Zelensky requested the presser before the signing (opposite of the norm). The deal was agreed upon with the state department and Zelensky came in and blew it up.

Zelensky just wants money. I can&#39;t believe the media is acting like Trump is wrong. The media is a disgrace I hope Zelensky doesn&#39;t get another penny he&#39;s PATHETIC.
Trump is not a president of USA he is a seller in the turkish bazaar and JD is the second pathetic person in the room after stupid guy in blue suit. That was madness, looks like a very bad movie. Stay strong Ukraine, stay strong mister president Zelensky.
Elensky repeated so many times for the last 3 years how Russia came first and occupied Ukraine territory, that you actually start questioning if this is true or not just because he keep saying this like he wants it to be true but it&#39;s really not the case
;You are gambling with World War Ill. You are gambling with World War IIl,; Trump of the freedom-loving country screams in horror to Zelensky, thus suggesting that Ukrainians submit to Russian slavery.Trump has disgraced America in front of the whole world.

Trump makes everything about himself making false claims about  his ability to get things done and he has embarrassed himself and the country with his pathetic diplomatic ability. He is no deal maker but a pathetic bully and a selfish sociopath. He won the election by narrow margins and did not receive the majority vote when third party votes are included. His presidency is a disaster.

I think that regardless of whether one&#39;s command of English is good, or even very good, such talks/meetings should have a translator. How can you seek balance when everybody speaks their mother tongue and you&#39;re struggling to understand what is being said? Has anyone of you been in such a situation? Adding and interpreter, gives you more time to gather your thoughts, think it over etc. Plus, it calms down the atmosphere when needed.It&#39;s simply not fair when your hosts meet you 2:1, throw jokes over your head and use colloquial language and you are left on your own to face it.I had the same once while working for the Spanish company. I was too good in Spanish for them to talk their broken English, yet too weak in Spanish to be on an equal footing. I think Zelenskiy didn&#39;t have comfort during the meeting, so when attacked by J.D. he just crashed.

JD Vance stuffed up the whole meeting. They were on the last question of a cordial and good meeting, and he suddenly takes it on himself to try and rebuke Zelensky, telling him he&#39;s being disrespectful. The arrogance from Vance was shameful. As a Christian, I am ashamed that you call yourself a brother in Christ and yet behave like that. You did not represent the King in that meeting. By your words, you showed yourself up. You owe Zelensky an apology for your atrocious behaviour. Trump is not a brother in Christ, so he doesn&#39;t know any better. But you Vance, you know better.
After watching the full meeting, it&#39;s Zelensky who started the fight.He needs to do reality check.

lol, but this is a purely Ukrainian lie. Everyone quickly forgot that it was Ukraine that violated Minsk-1, Ukraine violated Minsk-2, they openly admitted that they were not going to fulfill anything and were only accumulating forces, now the clown says that Putin will violate the agreements. It&#39;s just ridiculous)
Zelenskyy called JD Vance suka (motherfucker), I can‚Äôt believe that
This is embarrassing
The problem is we cannot keep funding this war Joe Biden started. It needs to stop. Donald Trump is trying to understand and ease tensions on both sides. Joe Biden was the complete agressor with this war, he started the war and he kept it going by just throwing more money at weapons toward it.DJT  wants to talk to both sides.
136 countries offered military assistance to the US after the 9/11 attacks. Can&#39;t remember any of them asking for their money back
When I first saw articles about this I was disappointed to hear about Trump&#39;s behavior, but after watching the full video Zelensky is clearly the one that initiated this chaos which seems to be ignored by the press.

I understood him they will NOT let him explain!
I remembered ;Madam Binh dancing with wolves;
Thank you for sharing this. A lot of media only shows parts of it.
Throughout history, America has sacrificed the lives of its own soldiers in wars around the world, standing as a defender of civilization and humanity. But it&#39;s disheartening to see the American media more worried about why a help-seeking president didn‚Äôt wear a suit rather than focusing on the reality in Ukraine‚Äîwhere so many lives have been lost, and so many more are still dying. And these American leaders are acting like dictators while advocating for free speech, yet they refuse to listen to this help-seeking president or give him a chance to explain why he believes a ceasefire deal alone won‚Äôt end the war or save the remaining innocent lives. America has always stood for justice‚Äîthis moment should be no different. Thousands have already died in this war, and countless more continue to die. These are human lives at stake. America needs to get back to what it truly is...The Righteous Power that has always stood up to defend and make the weak countries stronger...
Z is an embarrassment to humanity.  Vance showed his inexperience but he did better than Harris would have, cackle-cackle and more dumber statements than Biden would have done.  Trump is Trump and he is right! Z does not has a leg to stand on.   If Z refuses a treaty then let his country burn just as long as the American taxpayer receives its money back out of that shythole or we take their farmland as payment and declare that a territory of America.  We can send farmers there to grow more crops for US or sell it to reimburse the taxpayers.
Drumpf-Krasnov is a coward and a traitor. JD Vance is Peter Thiel&#39;s lapdog, a spineless coward.
America should apologise. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t hold my breath.
This will be a movie scene in the future.

We are waiting for the opening of the second front
The hostility started when conservative reporter asked Zelensky why doesn‚Äôt he wear a suit
At the beginning Zelenskyy says lots and lots of thanks. Why does he, the most powerful person, always avoid the important and dwell on the trivialÔºüAnd thanks for sharing this report that is closest to the facts and does not deceive.
Lots of bots in the comment section.
Zelenskyy is an idiot.
Putin is not a terrorist How Zelenskyy says he and his condolences
This should not have taken place.. In know way it looks like a serious bilateral discussion.. It looks like a circus going on.. Very unfortunate..
Putin nije Terrorist kako Zelenskyy kaze vec on i njegovi saucesnici
Vincent changed the whole demeanor of that meeting.  Then Trump followed suit. Wow.
Budapest Memorandum.
He walked into a media trap set by two new bullies at the White House.... one of the saddest scenes in world politics. By the way, congratulations on the classist observation of the fucking puppet journalist.
1. Zelensky didnt get to answer all the questions and rudely interrupted. He thanked USA both here and in the past. Vance was wrong about this.2. Trump banged on about being a peacemaker. Remembered as one3. Trump talked up his electoral win.4.  Zelensky understandably was exasperated. His body language was unfortunate but what did you expect.5. The question about a suit. Churchill wore battle clothing often in support of the forces fighting a warMy support and sympathy is with Zelensky. I hope Trump forges a pathway to peace that puts Ukraine, the victim at the centre.Valance was out of order, provocative and confrontational. Triggered Trump. Unfortunate.

Everything you do comes back 3x worse, remmber velsenkiThere were many reports of Black people being refused at¬†border crossings¬†in favor of white Ukrainians, leaving them stuck at borders for days in brutal conditions.

However, it seems they meant Ukrainian and European women and children.

There are even reports of¬†animals¬†being allowed on trains before Africans
Thank you C-span for showing the full press conference üôè
what  I got from this is Zelensky will only agree to end the war if its 100% on his terms.  Thats never gonna happen...

That&#39;s right, even though he&#39;s the Vice President of the United States he&#39;s not the equivalent authority level as Zekenskyy in the room. You&#39;d be surprised if he would run for presidency in 2028

This is whole thing is so much like a divorce it‚Äôs uncanny. This is what happens when a battered spouse (Ukraine) finally leaves her abuser (Russia). In my state (NC), you typically have to go through  mandatory mediation to try to get these people who hate each other to stop fighting. If you‚Äôre representing the victim of abuse‚Äîas I have done many times over the past 21 years‚Äîthey can demonstrate a LOT of the same behaviors that I feel I saw in Zelensky just now. He looks at the US like my clients look at me: help me beat this guy, fight for me. They‚Äôre proud of having stood up for themselves and the last thing they want to hear from their champion is settlement vocabulary. Their abuser is wrong and deserves to be punished; they, the victim, deserve vindication. If you don‚Äôt get it, maybe you‚Äôre not really on their side. It is totally understandable, and any idea that Russia should keep any of their plunder for any amount of time is morally revolting. But as I‚Äôve said again and again: there is a cost to being right. Do you want to pay it, or is there another way to a better future? I hate to say it, but I really understand why Tr/ance kind of went off here. I‚Äôve felt a little of that in situations where I‚Äôve worked a deal for somebody who already owes me money for my work and who I know will never be able to pay for a trial. Yes, the other side is wrong, but I‚Äôve got a lot of my own bills at home and I can‚Äôt let my employees or family suffer so that you can ‚Äúwin.‚Äù I would also add that no mediation will EVER be successful if a party sees the mediator talking mad cat turds about him. He‚Äôll have no credibility, and the personality disorder in the other room will kick into high gear. Slava Ukraini, I‚Äôm all about it, but I understand why Tr/ance kind of boiled over a little.

Top leaders of the world,please bear a humanity or good action towards the innocent people like Ukrainians
This video, from start to finish, tells a very different story than what is being perpetuated globally. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but due to body language, tone, and inflection, it seems that Zelenskyy is more aggressive in his positioning, prioritizing Ukraine‚Äôs wants over its needs. Yes, his country is at war, and Russia threw the first punch, yet his attitude and demeanor while asking for help seem based more on chance than reason or principle.The more I see, the more I understand the U.S. position. I am Canadian, and I don‚Äôt think this interaction was as much of a one-sided berating as the masses are being led to believe. I do believe we are on the precipice of a third global conflict. These are very dangerous and worrying times indeed.
Sorry I wouldn‚Äôt consider Zelensky a world leader. Being a president of a country doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a world leader‚Ä¶ lol
These men glorify their powers instead of glorifying God üôèüèº
Reporters need to be asking the White House how in the hell did an unauthorized reporter from Russia State TV gain access to the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelensky???¬†If no gets fired for this breach of security or no one takes the bullet and resigns, then it&#39;s clear Trump is in the bag for Russia and that should be every reporters follow-up question.
Zelensky is very brave to come to the WH and to carry on with a strong propaganda, despote he supported K.Harris ans is not even President anymore, but she&#39;d better explain whete the money is gone, being French, us European are very aware there are interests we are not seeing....we want a ceasefire quickly.

If Trump had a better supporting cast, America would be better.  But the supporting cast is lacking so there goes the chaos.
Trump said wasn‚Äôt under him when in fact earlier in meeting Zelensky stated agreement in 2010 was made and Putin broke it. If not mistaken Trump was president in 2019. How delusional can he be? Is this for show to manipulate his base or does he actually believe nonsense he spews?
Zelensky is on the defensive from the start of this press conference
Zel: &#39; I want peace. Sure. But Putin is a terrorist, a killer, a devil etc.&#39; With this attitude is going to be hard to talk. All what he said Zelensky talked to home.  Not to americans, not for peace, but for the countinous war...

No other U.S president treated an ally like Trump did, Imagine FDR telling Churchill ;Make peace or you&#39;re on your own;  It was a huge embarrassment for the U.S
What pisses me off is nobody really has their own opinions anymore. Everyone just mirrors whatever their news source says as their firm belief even if its something they never knew anything about until 3 minutes ago. Like my coworker was calling zelenski a clown. So i asked why is he a clown? He had no answer. He got embarrassed and said oh i saw something on tv the other day but i forgot what it was. He didnt even realize he was just repeating whatever he hears. And ive been kinda seeing the same thing in comments all the time. Called z a clown or not a president. I can tell you right now hes more of a real humam being than most of our politicians are. I have actively searched for dirt on him trying to figure out why is he a clown? Whats so bad about him? I literally cant find anything. The only thing is he keeps asking for help and were all getting anoyyed giving out free help which is understandable but why are we hating on him for asking for help?. The other day one dude was like he is stealing from AmericansüòÇ. Im like wtf are you talkimg about. Everyone complaining about our hard earned tax dollars going there.. as if its really effecting you personally and coming out of your pockets. And as if any of you are ever aware of what they typically spend our tax money on. Regardless you have to pay x amount of taxes. We freaking print money. This whole thing is so stupid
Why would these world leaders have an important meeting set up like a shit show? They can&#39;t talk in private?? Trump (the U.S.) just wanted a ;show; to try and embarass Zelensky. If WW3 starts, it is totally  because of TRUMP. Dickhead Trump thinks he is a 1500&#39;s colonist, trying to rule the world.

Trump and Zelensky planned this together in order to trick Putin and Russian voters.  Putin desperately wants out of the war, but he can&#39;t appear weak in front of his people.  In order to help Putin, Trump is acting like he respects Putin and Russia.   The Russian people believed this act and loved this exchange.  Trump is much smarter than people give him credit for being.

What attack is Vance talking about? Did they have a sidebar that we did not see?  He needs to fill us in.
When Mencius first met King Hui of Liang, he sought to guide him toward righteousness rather than the mere pursuit of profit. He warned, ;If those above and below compete for gain, the state will inevitably fall.; These words, spoken centuries ago, still carry weight today.Trump and Vance, emboldened by the power of a great nation, seem intent on advancing their own interests at any cost. They turn a blind eye to facts, dismiss the broader currents of global affairs, and ignore the voices of ordinary people. Rather than engaging with smaller nations through respect and understanding, they attempt to strong-arm them into submission under the guise of righteousness. It is a troubling display‚Äîleaders who wield immense influence yet choose coercion over cooperation, force over fairness. They may believe they hold the reins of history, but history itself has a way of restoring balance, reminding us that true leadership is measured not by dominance, but by justice.
Zelensky looks more fit, younger and handsome than the ones in the suits.  Maybe they are jealous of his youthful good look.

The clown who said, Why don‚Äôt you wear a suit? ü§°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
From the beginning of the press conference, Zelensky&#39;s body language says it all. He&#39;s bothered and appears ready to pop. Trump begins composed and courteous. Throughout the press conference, whenever Trump talks about his dialogue with Putin, Zelensky either shakes his head or contradicts the idea that negotiation can work, unless Russia first pulls out its military (something which simply won&#39;t happen). It&#39;s clear that Z doesn&#39;t like what Trump is doing in regard to Russia. This running subtle tug-of-war goes on for the first 40 minutes or so. Then, Vance begins chiming in more and suggests that Z should be ;thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.; Should be ;thanking; instead of what? Instead of resisting the President&#39;s efforts to dialogue with Russia.Obviously, Z has thanked the USA very many times, but he&#39;s resisting the President&#39;s strategy to end the war rather than thanking him for doing so. It&#39;s frustrating how few people seem to be catching this important nuance in the conversation.
You explained this so well, thank you!
Trump and Vance are the epitome of profoundly arrogant narcissism.What an absolute clown show.

Little Zelensky wants to be seen as a war leader which is why he keeps wearing army gear but he isn&#39;t a soldier, he&#39;s just a clown and the only thing that he can shoot is his mouth.
Zelensky is a corrupt child who cares little for his people. He only wants money and USA is done giving it away like candy. Time to stop this nonsense.
But hey, at least that exposed what Trump and Vance&#39;s real intentions were.
Liar Zelenskyy , get out of USA .
if world war 3 does happen, trump will have to fork out a lot more than some security measures. i can respect him sticking to his guns and putting america first but it seems like zelenskyy knows what he wants and won&#39;t settle for less and, frankly, i can&#39;t blame him.

@@jakobrasmussen1645 I would eventually like to see trump in front of a camera after all his crap presidency is over ( pity it couldn&#39;t happen before. He would not have even been in the government in Australia) and fill him with the truth serum(sodium pentathol I think or anything else they got that works) and make him spill the beans on every lie he has told. He has told so many, even in that meeting with Zelensky. He&#39;s a pathological liar and can&#39;t help it but it&#39;s for attention too. Black cat, black panther man. trump probably stopped a couple fights in the school yard as a kid and that&#39;s the wars he is talking about. trump really doesn&#39;t care about soldiers dying either no matter which country they are from by the way he has spoken about them being losers and they were US soldiers he spoke about.Even at Arlington Heights. Being a person from the 60s I just wonder if trump took a lot of acid way back then as his brain works like it&#39;s had lots of trips.

@@spudpony9708 ¬†¬†¬†that&#39;s a dumb comment. Maybe learn what gaslighting actually means first, and then after that you can learn that nothing is particular to America. Get off your ;I&#39;ll just say something negative about America, even though it makes zero sense, because I want to insult something to sound cool and smart but I&#39;m really lazy; bandwagon.
Zelensky is out of line, when he started attacking Vance, it went downhill really fast. Zelensky wants a military victory, and it is not going to happen. You have to get a ceasefire deal. Yes, Putin can violate it, then there has to be a big price to pay if he does violate it. You cannot militarily win against Russia; not without a world war, and there is no need to.
Zelensky wants them to bash Putin which is a HORRIBLE move
Sadly! This meeting needed more effort and involves more skills and  diplomacy to prepared.
If you watch this entire video. JD Vance really blows this whole thing up. It is kept really civil and respectful until JD Vance is just completely out of line.
If you vote a joker as president your country will definitely go for war. People want to see USSR
Great video.
Zelensky acted more like a leader than Trump. However, when it comes to freedom of speech that doesn‚Äôt exist when dealing with a child like Trump. Being truthful about Putin and not bashing falsely Biden? That doesn‚Äôt work well with someone like Trump.

Did you guys notice that should tap of JD at the end?That was something elseüòÆ
No. Go back and look that the situation entirely.  This is supposed to be a ceremonial signing of a mineral rights agreement.  That&#39;s why the cameras are there and parts of congress.  Its not a litigation meeting.   Zelinksy was looking for his moment to make a protest scene in front of the cameras.  The guy is an actor so he knows the value of PR.  He just used what JD Vance said as his in-road to start his protest.  JD is an easy target because he is just the Vice President and it looks better if he doesn&#39;t go after Trump immediately.  He knows very well Trump is going to jump in and make a scene.   The banter exchange you saw should have already taken place before the deal was struck.  It was all for the cameras.
Trump cannot say that Zelensky is being rude to him.    Zelensky has shown respect to Trump several times, but respect does not mean obedience. Ukraine does not have to please the USA or show its thanks in any special way.    America is the strongest country now not because it has special achievements, but because it was simply lucky. In World War II, Europe was destroyed, the Soviet Union lost tens of millions of people, and the USA, which is surrounded by ;nice oceans;, easily made money. This gave them a chance to get ahead of everyone and look down on other countries while they recovered.    Ukraine is forced to fight not because it wants to, but because its location makes it a victim. If it were not Ukraine, there would be another country that Russia would try to control (Moldova, Georgia, Chechnya). Trying to calm an aggressor means simply giving the country to others, and then losing it.    This talk is nothing more than a waste of American taxpayers‚Äô money and a way for one politician to make himself feel important. It does not solve real problems and makes him seem important, while his decisions will be forgotten and can be ignored by Russia in 4 years.    This could have been a normal negotiation with real promises (unlike the Budapest Memorandum, the Minsk Agreements, Article 353 of the Russian Criminal Code, and Article 79 of the Russian Constitution), but in the end, it only took Zelensky‚Äôs time with accusations that he could have used to deal with more important military issues.
JD should have kept his mouth shut. Things were going fine until he opened his mouth
No, Zelenskyy wants peace. The problem is that peace under the terms Trump has already given up to Putin isn&#39;t peace. It is going to be Europe in pieces. That is a fact, based on Putin&#39;s action, goals, and desires. It is Trump, by his actions and honor of Putin, a known thug with large territorial dreams that is bringing us closer to WWIII. So I ask you, why would you risk WWIII when you can avoid it by opposing tyranny? Putin&#39;s forces are having a lot of trouble attempting to defeat Ukraine, and that is with all the help that the Republicans gave him by cutting funding and starving the Ukrainians of necessary arms to defend their country. BTW, you look way too young to remember the Cold War. Russia has been rattling the nuclear saber, and actual sabers forever. Some of us learned, wisely, to ignore ;the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets;. Putin is, in the end, a coldly rational creep who knows that one use of a nuclear weapon wonder end him. The Soviets long feared we would actually even try a first strike. We thought they would. MAD was not actually mad. Not standing up to Putin by letting him have what he wants just encourages him. Providing Ukraine what it needs to defeat Putin&#39;s war machine doesn&#39;t escalate the conflict. It contains and removes it. Putin will stop only when he is forced to stop. All of this is Putin&#39;s fault. Ukraine didn&#39;t invade Russia and neither did anyone else in the West since the Nazis. Putin has been interfering in the internal affairs of many countries for decades, literally getting away with murder. Trump isn&#39;t being Strong. He is being weak, like Mussolini attempting to grab up the spoils by honoring Hitler. Putin&#39;s territorial goals are like a Hitler, and the way all Russian monarchs have treated the people of defeated lands has been as virtual slaves. Actually, long ago, they really were slaves. They called them serfs. In the case of Ukraine, the Russians just killed them,  or starved them, or took them off to the Gulags. That is ;realistic;.

Zelinsky is in a fantasy world...
Cocaine played a big part in this interview.
So let me get this straight.  The U.S. was The perpetrator behind the 2014 coup via Victoria Nuland. Then the government of the Ukraine sent troops trained by the U.S. to their Eastern provinces   to begin shelling ethnic Russians &amp; Ukrainians. The Minsk Accords, among other things, was to create a cease fire. Angela Merkel was the one who spilled the beans that the Minsk Accords were just a diversion to build up NATO forces and use the Ukrainians to spearhead an offensive against Russia and to overthrow Putin. By the way, J.D. Vance was the one who started the argument at the end. Earlier he was all about freedom of speech, and yet he got tired of what Zelensky had to say, accused him of not being grateful to America, raised his voice and attacked Zelensky, which opened the opportunity for Trump to become bellicose. What about Zelensky&#39;s freedom to speak his opinions? They could have disagreed without raising their voices. They just didn&#39;t like the words coming out of Zelensky&#39;s mouth. Trump went on describing himself as a victim of the previous administration&#39;s attempt to get rid of him...one way or the other. He carries that victim mentality. Putin will eat him up alive during negotiations and spit him out. Trump revealed his achilles heel. We need some very rational negotiators who understand that all wars from here on in are resource wars, and understand the Russian rationale. The U.S. government actors want to dig themselves out of 35 - 70 T. debt using resource rich countries like Ukraine.
where can I find the document they talk about?
Trump will become one of the greatest President - he loves this country.

So narcissistic, Me-me-me-me....Good God! What an embarrassment for the US!!!
I think Pres. Trump didn&#39;t know how to express or pick a better word than &#39;&#39;hatred&#39;&#39;, that was the word that made Mr. Zele. trip and become more aggressive.
Yeah, but everyone is tired of Zelensky&#39;s bitchy tone. I&#39;d rather listen to Trump explaining why Ukraine doesn&#39;t get any more money, arms or ammo. If Zelensky can&#39;t come up with some way to end the war, then its just him begging for more money like he&#39;s done for the last 3 years.
When you are in audience with Don Carleone....that&#39;s the character, albeit fictional,  that Trumpster should compare himself to.
Thank you, America, for voting J.D. Vance. He is a bully

It would be great if he could provide us some accurate accountability‚Ä¶ like how did you use the money that was sent over there.

I hate Putin! To squander human resources like this.
Humans are not robots, they forget things, it‚Äôs normal.
Dumb move by Zelensky. He talked too much.
Trump wants to strip mine the conflict border of Ukraine, European troops to patrol the area, making it a DMZ stopping fighting between Ukraine and Russia, acting like an ally shield and put US independent contractors in the DMZ, get back financial aid losses from Biden, create trade package with Putin as well, allow Russia to hold the areas near Crimea and time to get back into the green with money situation and army in Russia, Zelensky wont take that deal in whole but if given Nato membership would allow areas like Crimea to return to Russia if they choose to.
The Trump administration has not mentioned the Budapest Memorandum at all. All it has on its mind is business, and it is trampling on America&#39;s commitments to the world.
he Zelensky says he wants to stop the war and when the Russians came to Turkey to sign documents to stop the war and this same President Zelensky refused not to sign any documents not to talk to the Russians he himself is to blame he refused to sign documents. and now they complain to the Trump how he lies and how he is not ashamed. President Trump said correctly this Zelensky he is nobody, then the Russians did not enter Ukraine in 2014 Ukrainians and President Poroshenko he killed civilians Ukraine Donetsk and Lugansk regions why they killed civilians and it turns out that Russians lived there, this news was from the side of the American journalist and when the Ukrainians found out American journalists are filming the whole truth and then when Zelensky came to power and killed the American journalist all this political from Ukrain  so don&#39;t believe Zelensky he says Putin stole children from Ukraine and he changed their name surname they are not from Ukraine they turn out to be from Donetsk and Lugansk regions and no one changed the name surname this is the truth an American journalist showed. this is all Joyce&#39;s policy Biden and the Europeans wanted a war with Russia to use Ukrainian lands President Trump does not want a third world war and he does not want to fight with Russia and he wants peace and to live on PEACEFULLY
He gave the Trump administration the middle finger. Ukraine will be a parking lot by the summer.

Calling Putin an opportunist instead of an dictator and killer is just wrong. Putin doesn&#39;t need public support to invade a country at all. He simply kills and imprisons the people against him, because he is a dictator. The UdSSR was a regime too. He wants the power back.

Zelensky clearly began by expressing gratitude and made it evident that he wants this war to end.Zelensky simply asked a logical and intelligent question. Given that diplomacy hasn‚Äôt worked in the past, how would it work this time? It was a fair and reasonable question. However, I genuinely believe JD Vance didn‚Äôt know how to respond, so instead of addressing the question, he deflected by attacking Zelensky, accusing him of being disrespectful and criticizing the administration.I also didn‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs posture toward Zelensky. I agree that he was right to correct Zelensky when he mentioned that America would feel the consequences of a ;bad ocean; in the future, as that remark was unnecessary. However, Trump should have limited his correction to that point and should have kept the conversation calm and answered Zelensky‚Äôs question, as Zelensky, being the president of a country under attack, has every right to understand how the U.S. believes its proposed solution will succeed.Instead, Trump also attacked Zelensky, echoing JD Vance‚Äôs accusations of disrespect. The meeting had been going so well until the Vice President and the President disrupted it. I felt genuinely sad for Zelensky because, by the end, he was completely shut down, he didn‚Äôt get another word in, and no one stood up for him or corrected what had happened..

France actually had ;boots on the ground; in our war for independence. Guess you believe in the sentiment, ;go ahead and cheat a friend.;Or maybe one of your more recent ancestors thought Chamberlain was right. Lindbergh was right to support Hitler. Joe Kennedy was right when he wanted Churchill out so a peace could be made with Hitler because Joe Kennedy, who was also clueless, thought Hitler&#39;s forces were going to be storming the beaches of the east coast of Britain. Never mind that Britain&#39;s navy would have ;Trump is too realistic to attempt that.;  You really believe that is realistic, rather that cowardly, venal, and just wanting to suck up to Putin, his buddy. As an old Cold Warrior; I resent the absurd implication that only lefty&#39;s would support Ukraine wanting to be free of Russia, a country that was COMMUNIST. It&#39;s not a leftist concept to defend a democracy, a state that wishes to be free and independent, but it does take a supporter of dictators of any stripe, communist, fascist, or imperial to think capitulating to and making someone who represents their country to capitulate to a dictator. Said dictator that is actually having a lot of trouble defeating a nation that has been being starved for necessary munitions to fight a war due to ;realistic; Republicans in the US Congress because they are cowards, using as an excuse that it is too costly.  That cost basis, like this was just a cold business decision without serious ramifications that will make that bottom line look really bad later, yeah, that is just being realistic. So give Putin whatever he wants, insult and bully the actual victims into accepting occupation, likely death and certainly a form of slavery is being ;realistic;.  You are so suckered by that sucker who is a sucker enough to believe Putin will actually honor an agreement. Putin breaks agreements. He kills political opponents. His military is pathetic. Yet the realistic move is to blame the actual victims and honor the dictator thug who murders thousands of people, invades any nearby state he can get away with and interferes with elections in numerous other countries. But then I guess you probably believe Putin, too.

@ Typically respect is a mutual thing. And if one doesn&#39;t show respect why should the other? Also I don&#39;t see where and how they failed. They were nice until Z started to spew nonsence about ceasefire. The ceasefire deal was sabotaged by the europeans, ask Merkel.
;a lot of questions; - Boy eyeliner boy sure knows a lot about war with his rhetorical questions.This new season of the Apprentice is terrible; the old man should retire and they should bring back Omorosa for some color to the white man room.
@@Dunny16 what a pathetic response.  He says thank you on at least another two occasions in the entire video. You‚Äôre just upset that there‚Äôs blatant evidence against what you want to believe. Big thank you small thank you who cares he says thank you on so many occasions, including this one.
This is a tragic moment in world history. I&#39;m terrified by the consequences.
He is very well aware of that or this talk would have gotten very ugly. The problem is the fact that the deal Trump tries to make is absolutely unacceptable for Ukraine.

Zelenskyy refused to sign 50% with Vance and then lost the opportunity to sign 50% with Trump so perhaps he&#39;ll sign over 60% with Marco Rubio.
Trump is an embarrassment to our country.
To all Americans who voted this idiot in to presidency who reckons he‚Äôs the hero who will save the world, utter bullsh*t of a man. Making a mockery of your country. He‚Äôs for himself and only himself. He‚Äôll be the one who causes another world war. He wants to make money so wants to rinse and destroy a country who is already under attack and suffering. Zelensky has always thanked and shown gratitude. Whilst your vice president and president take the piss out of the man trying to hold his country together. What a stupid question about his clothes Brian! The man is representing his country which is under attack, I think the last thing on his mind is what colour suit and tie he‚Äôs going to wear. Well done America for voting a moron into power! Shame on you!
@Veroniq12 I thought beetroot meant ;machinations /presence of Russians;, usually in English in such a sentence it would be translated exactly like this
47.30 trump thinks that Putin respects him but not biden and obama. And thats the big mistake he is making. Putin does not respect anybody.He is just damn good at manipulating people he needs to get himself out of trouble. And than he is going to shift that blame over to all the enemies he had to hurt them as much as possible. This will be a mess until Putin is dead.

I know right? why nobody point out this? Everyone in this comment section and instagram just commenting on how Trump bad at diplomacy, while he want peope being killed.
Hello everyone I watched this news, I am not Russian and not Ukrainian. I understood Zelensky, he is lying, he is not telling the truth, he is lying and also lied to the French and Europeans, and if he says that he really wants to stop the war, he would immediately tell President Trump, let&#39;s leave this war and that&#39;s it, and they, the Americans, would help stop the war. But he just sits and lies to Trump, and Zelensky wants the Americans to fight with Russia, and Zelensky is a stupid person who will lie to everyone, he wants a third world war, that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt believe Zelensky, he just wants war.
Americans are the perfect combination of Funny and stupid.
Rich people are thinking only on money and business...God bless Ukraine
This is not a GENUINE conversation. Trust me.

I love this fresh untouched lives TV. Trump dare to live this to the whole world. European and Ukrain broke the promised by not any expanding NATO more but the broke it. So Russian need to protect themselves. Behind that because bidder&#39;s son traded weapons with weapons companies and they want mass up and war, so Biddens families and son would gain billions by putting all taxs of all American that suppose to spending for Americans into weapons companies and send to Ukraine, So Biddens side thought that Biddens is just a business man don&#39;t have ability and that non surprise that behind all Trumps assassination Biddens,his son&#39;s and his supporters who will lost big profits including Zelenzky want and trying to kill Trump. God save Mr Trump and his great team.
Kudos to Trump and Vance for putting this clown in his rightful place. Zelensky likes to act tough riding on the power and influence of others. He can continue fighting with his own money. Thanks to president Trump for fulfiling an election promise. American money belongs to Americans, not to Ukraine. This is not our war.

Very nice play.
Zelensky needs to learn negotiating and diplomatic skills. Is this the first time he is meeting Trump? Unfortunately if you are a President, you need to put your ego aside for the sake of your people. That is if he wants a deal.
Putin did a bad thing invading Ukraine but there was armed conflict in Ukraine before that. Ukraine is not completely absent of any responsibility for this conflict. Putin is an opportunist and he saw an opportunity to invade Ukraine because he could generate public support. Why was he able to generate that public support? Why did the USSR collapse? The Russian people felt wronged. The world is a complicated place &amp; US citizens are clueless to its complexities which is why they are easily propagandized.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
The American people actually voted for this guy to represent them. Wild!
He is thinking about his people and he is the one in the war. Don&#39;t you think he knows that trump and putin are really about money and land and any signing of a rare earth deal would have been wrong at this time. Try and use your computer and see what Russia has done while Putin has been in control against Ukraine and while you are at it go back to 2006 and see what trump has been doing to people before politics. trump and Vance were rude to a guest in the US government&#39;s house. Zelensky said thank you many times but he knows he was sitting next to a convicted criminal and rapist and a habitual liar and facts are there to see.
Trump&#39;s main wishes were about minerals, or resources to be traded. Not nearly enough to do with anything related to the war. Personally, I wish Putin were there in the same room. I&#39;d be curious to see what happened. Not sure how much Trump would have to do with it.
@@misterjameswest all the US support has been from from Biden and not Trump or his MAGA republican Congress cult members. How many times has the republicans tried to stop support for Ukraine because Trump wanted it stopped?!? Zelenskyy thanked many times, but this wasn&#39;t good enough. Go ahead and tell me you LOVE communism without telling me by supporting Trump. The right called democrats marxists, socialists, communists, and worst and yet you blindly back a felon who doesn&#39;t give a crap about defending a democratic country who&#39;s fighting for it&#39;s right to EXIST. Seems to me that all you Trumpers are actually aligning with communist beliefs and a communist dictator who has Trump in his pocket.

Zelenskyy is responsible for starting this war instead of considering the security concerns of neighbouring countries. He is a puppet in the hands of Left Eco system and not concerned with the lives of citizens of Ukraine .
People seem to forget that the guy in the top job is a convicted criminal and rapist and also has cost the US taxpayers $10.7 million dollars already for 10 days of trump golf playing at his own courses where he can bill accommodation and everything else for his entourage and security detail and people have said about his first term he made no money while in office, so it seems like that is a lie with 307 days playing golf and now he starts filling the T Organisation with government money while cutting everything he can to the bone. He is in office for the attention but more than that really to make money and he actually should be in jail and remains unaccountable yet for so many things. Probably some of you had relatives die because he waited 70 days to declare a National Emergency and actually had to be talked into it by advisors.  trump wants the rare earth minerals and can&#39;t even say the word properly, it&#39;s ;rare; not raw Donny. trump is actually doing the same things he did in business before politics and he caused people to take their lives because he ruined them with going back on deals and lawyering up and people lost their livelihoods. Bully all his life and he actually forgot he called Ukraine President a Dictator previously on camera and musket x tweet social rant and said he only had 4% rating in office but it&#39;s 57%. trump doesn&#39;t care about Ukraine. Ohhhh they let a Russian press person in the Oval office too, mmm how did he get in? Why they ask about a suit is stupid. He is in a state of war and a suit means nothing. The blame game will roll off Donny&#39;s lips and he will never do anything wrong but hopefully one day he will get the orange suit he deserves and Vance too. Funny how the set up assassination went out of the news quickly and Reagan&#39;s assassination attempt lasted for months. Zelensky didn&#39;t bow down to a criminal and the rest of the world agrees.
@@stanislavg.7903 Russian propaganda from a lying pig.   It is simple. Putin is a thug.   Minsk... No they weren&#39;t breaking Minsk, but your comrades did violate many agreements, meddling in Ukraine&#39;s internal affairs, and invading because when you couldn&#39;t keep your fascist thug in power when Ukraine wanted to join the EU. Putin tried again, and the Ukrainians still didn&#39;t want a dictator. So Putin sent his ;little green men;, lying  by saying they weren&#39;t Russian soldiers.   BTW, what Putin&#39;s Russia is is not any kind of democracy. He kills or imprisons anyone capable of opposing him. He is a cross between an Imperial Russian monarch and a fascist, a new Adolph Hitler, complete with the territorial goals.  Oh brother, Ukraine is very much a victim of Russia. Loving mother Russia, again. Ukraine, unlike that wacky and demented view of history Putin spits out about Ukraine and Europe. Like the demented idea that Poland started WWII because they didn&#39;t just capitulate to Hitler when Hitler told the Poles that he wanted to annex them. Ukraine and the West are not at fault for the invasions of Ukraine. That is all on Russia. Ukraine has fought against being any part of Russia for centuries. But Russia just won&#39;t leave them alone. This goes to the warped idea that you and your comrades have that NATO forced Poland and other of you former enslaved states join NATO. No, dear silly person. I&#39;m sorry, but they came running and screaming to join the EU and NATO. The EU and NATO wouldn&#39;t accept them for many years. They had to earn a place. No one in the West forced them to join. The thuggish way your country treated them made them happy to be out from under your yoke, which was just about the same as being under Nazi occupation. They wanted out so bad that East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia all tried to break free. Your country was foolishly trusted after WWII to occupy Eastern Europe. Part of those agreements were that free and fair election were to be held regularly in the areas liberated from the Nazis. The Soviets promptly broke all such agreements. People hated being under your rule so much that they fled by the millions to areas under British, French or US control after the war. Then, as time went on, they continued to flee to the West so much your country caged them behind walls, barbed wire and guards with machine guns.  And that is what you want for Ukraine, provided you don&#39;t try to exterminate them all and erase Ukrainian culture, as Russia has tried to do for centuries. This idea of Western military bases in Ukraine is a Russian lie. The Ukrainians have military bases in Ukraine. They do not and did not want soldiers from other countries in Ukraine. But we have a saying in the English speaking countries, ;Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it;.   GO away with your lies.

They want to disrespect and try to embarrass Zelenskyy and his citizens. He&#39;s clearly not trying to help Ukraine. He&#39;s all about what sort of kickbacks he can receive based on the ;rare earths;....how fucking embarrassing....
Trump is a genius, he showed that Zelensky is a slave of Biden and the English, he needs war and only war, because he belongs entirely to England, he is ready to destroy Ukraine for the sake of the desires of the elites from England. It is very funny to read the comments of the Democrats, who look like zombies, they are zombies, because their brains are completely washed by the propaganda of the sick old man Biden...

As a Trump fan I will say i dont like the way him and Vance handled this. The news is making Zalenski out to be disrespectful. I side with Trump on the gameplan but Zalenski didnt deserve that. Also if Bidens just throwing money at him with reckless abandon id campaign with their party to he doesnt care about our politics hes just trying to keep his house of cards from falling over. Zalenski and the Ukrainians are going to have to get over this whole thing mentally and thats going to be the hardest thing to achieve if longlasting peace is to be established. Trump just needs to stop getting himself into an ego battle every single time the opportunity presents himself. Yes it&#39;s a great thing to have alot of the time and im happy he is the way he is to some extent but this was not the time or place for it.

I expected more than just talk about a deal, a suit and free speech in GB which of course must be discussed but not when two presidents meet to talk about stopping a war. Off topic Qs must&#39;ve been ignored.And tbh I don&#39;t like Z, the way he talked about democracy while skipping an election and talking like Russia started war with 0fkn provocation, but the way he was ignored a lot of times, and he literally had to fight to have a chance to reply and see him choked on the word multiple times was hard to watch.
Thats exacly how he manipulate all the Europa !!! Putin going to come for you and Putin Putin Putin .. and alll ejere so stupid and trusted him !!

Putin has no limits, no  consciousness no fear of anyone on this earth!!! He mercilessly killed all enemies! He does what he wants, he doesn&#39;t care about anything! He was able to put his opponent Navalnic in a maximum security prison without any fault and killed him easily to be sure to get rid of a worry. So the USA has to help Ukraine, now is the time, otherwise Putin will win and conquer, which is much easier, Moldova and any country he wants. It will be unstoppable from this point of view too! Putin must be jailed he killed so many people!
This was super helpful, thanks!
Zelensky was clearly frustrated and flabbergasted with how he was treated even before the spat. Didn&#39;t get a chance to respond to most questions. You could tell he was extremely tense from the beginning and despised the way Trump was going about it that day and in the lead up.You can only imagine his thinking. Sitting there listening to not only Trump but the reporters pump Trump up. Overall I think he misinterpreted what the oval office conference.
@@stanislavg.7903Russian paranoia at its finest. Russian leaders have always been paranoid and tyrannical historically, even though the West and the EU have no intention of invading them.

Zelensky referring to an opposing military force as killers is just sensationalism and should be shut down. These are soldiers under orders to fight. It is not unlawful killing.

Settle down sandy vagina or I will put you outside
Here it is clearly visible that the President of Ukraine is right and completely right!!! It was a very serious mistake that the US Government, in agreement with the Kremlin, reached such an agreement to disarm nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. In other words, the US Government unknowingly contributed to this war and the Kremlin was already organizing it in a deliberate manner, what will happen next. By the Pope, as it was written ;SECURITY GUARANTEES; recorded in the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994 by the United States, Russia and Great Britain. The President of Ukraine says what is ;VERY OBVIOUS;. Since in the war of the Russian Federation with Chechnya, the Russian side violated the conditions of stopping the hostilities on a joint decision in accordance with the agreement, then it is ;COMPLETELY OBVIOUS; that this time it will be exactly the same. The Kremlin operates schematically. But the worst thing in all this is that the President of the USA knows that such a possibility exists. The president of the USA is simply playing his business games with the president of the Russian Federation, playing with the Ukrainian nation. So everyone knows about it, ;BUT; now he is pretending as he is pretending, because he has some interest in it only for himself and wealth for the Americans. In 7 months, as it is estimated, the millionth Ukrainian soldier is to die. The only thing that should be done is not even to talk to the Kremlin, it will be a lie on the part of the Kremlin and it is obvious, it is understandable!!! It should be done so that the forces on the Ukrainian and Russian border install soldiers on the model of IFOR. If the Russian side breaks the terms of the agreement and kills these soldiers, and it is known that it will be, they will also say that it was Ukrainian soldiers who killed. All that is left is to bring NATO soldiers into the territory of Ukraine to protect the IFOR soldiers. Then the Kremlin will make a decision to kill both, IFOR and NATO and as always the Ukrainians are to blame for this because it is certainly their fault. In summary, either the US government will play with paper agreements, which it is known that the Kremlin will break, not for the first time and not for the last time. Or NATO will have to install soldiers on Ukrainian territory because they protect IFOR soldiers. There will be an open war between the Russian Federation and NATO. There is another option, introducing war mercenaries from different parts of the world, providing weapons. The Kremlin will not make sense in this, gaining part of Ukraine for the Russian Federation will not be significant at all on the scale of the entire Russian Federation, it is a war about nothing specifically important, only a purely ideological game, in which ;maybe; 2 million Russian soldiers will die in the end. Of course, the Russian Federation will lose this war for obvious reasons, they are weaker in every respect. The question is about the number of fatalities, also war mercenaries, on the part of Western European soldiers (NATO). Because if the US government still wants to make paper agreements with the Kremlin and nothing comes of it. So either NATO will have to take up the fight with the Russian Federation anyway or Ukraine will simply have to surrender. So, to sum up, how will it pay off for the US president (?) WARMEST REGARDS
Not a fan of trump but he‚Äôs right human are dying every day in this war and this needs to stop

I think it is not difficult to understand why JD Vance and Trump went pissed off simply because Z does not agree with their approach to stop the war and started taking control of the meeting, lecturing Trump about Putin&#39;s untrustworthy natures since <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1800">30:00 onwards. If I were any of Trump or JD Vance, I would be pissed off as well because he is basically publicly calling me stupid to trust Putin on any deals while it is Zelensky who wants aid. It feels like Zelensky is in a boss position while he is loosing a war.
Trumps fucking high on himself! Could he actually spit some proper facts out. Guys a clown
I hate how everyone thinks Zelensky is some god or some perfect innocent person!!! When he was instilled by the CIA after they over through Yanukovych (a democratically elected president). They removed him because he didn‚Äôt want to be a part of nato because that would be a hostile act towards Russia and mean instant war! So they removed him and put someone who would do whatever they asked when they asked it. Even though in 1990 Secretary of State James Baker promised Gorbachev and other Soviet officials, ‚Äúnot one inch eastward‚Äù meaning they wouldn‚Äôt expand nato one inch eastward past Germany, yet they knew they were lying and stilled said it!!! CIA Director Robert Gates‚Äôs criticism of ‚Äúpressing ahead with expansion of NATO eastward [in the 1990s], when Gorbachev and others were led to believe that wouldn‚Äôt happen.‚ÄùThats literally from the documents so for those who don‚Äôt believe the CIA‚Äôs involvement with this then think again!! They‚Äôve been trying to get Russia surrounded by nato even and then take that too since the 90‚Äôs!!! Putin at one point was even thinking about joining nato and had asked about it until the US broke ever agreement they made with him!! So no Zelensky, Putin didn‚Äôt just come to your land and start blazing bullets for no reason it‚Äôs a lot more complex then that but he likes to play the victim!!! Thats like all the BRICS nations getting Mexico to join them then placing military bases there along with missiles and other weapons the expecting the US not to act on it by attacking Mexico!!! Like obviously they‚Äôre going too which they would have ever right to do so!!! Zelensky knew exactly what he was doing when he chose to join nato not because of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù but because that was the deal he made with the CIA‚Ä¶ He chose to do it and get hundreds of thousands of his people killed along with having to give up land too Russia and even then he still kidnaps young men to make them fight for fuck sakes!!! This guy is as evil as the worst of them!!! Yet everyone thinks he so innocent üòá that is sooo far from the truth I can‚Äôt believe people are stupid enough to believe it and think that he deserves to have anything given to him!!! Oh well if he keeps acting like this don‚Äôt be surprised when he gets assented by Putinü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Ä¶..

Zelensky showed expression in his eyes when Trump poked at the Biden Administration.
@Monotonous-Tedium¬† I make you aware that Ukraine has a chance to win the war with honor, without giving Putin&#39;s ass like Trump is doing.
I feel zelensky already has them minerals sold to other buyers like blackrock or whover like everything else he looks very worried he&#39;s white hes on very thin ice he wanted trunp to say stuff bad about putin they say their playig cards puting is playing chess its about checkmate zelensky will be killed by naziz azoz
All Zelensky did was say I need need more funds, I need air systems, I need etc. Maybe he should be thankful that the U.S. has been his major backer for three years and without the U.S., Zelensky probably wouldn&#39;t still have a country now.
Vance  obviously does not like Zelensky and is there to cause problems, he is waiting to attack him at every opportunity, this is sickening both Trump and Vance are rude. Zelensky was not dicating anything he was trying to say the U.S is protected by oceans and they used his lack of the English language as a tool against him, both Trump and Vance are very rude. Neither are there to help this is a publicity stunt and nothing more. Putin and Trump have secret deals going on, I&#39;m sure of it and it will all come out in the wash later, mark my words! This is about deminishing Zelensky&#39;s credibility and to make him look like a fool, Im glad it backfiired on Trump and Vance as they are the ones who look ike fools. The world is behind Zelensky. Notice how he says  ;this will be great television;, that is what this is all about as far as Trump is concerned, its all to further promote himself as usual. When Zelensky was attacked for not wearing a suit, he should have replied with why does your president paint himself orange? and carry on like a spoilt brat? Also, why are you showing off in front of the camera?, do you believe this will make you more popular by behaving like this and trying to belittle me? by wearing army green he is showing solidarity with his troops! In Trumps aging and possibly demented mind he is seeing Zaelensky as Castro, as Castro always wore army green. I believe this is why he was previously calling him a dictator, he is possibly confusing him for Castro or drawing parallels between Zelensky and Castro in his aging mind due to wearing army green a lot of the time. In regards to Zelensky being a dictator as Trump previously stated, due to not holding elections, he cannot call an election in Ukraine currently. Half the country are fighting, the other half are trying to survive or have left the country and are in Poland and other countries. Also, now is not the time to assemble large amounts of people in one place. Putin would see the polling places as nothing but a huge target to attack to do maximum damage!  Surely Trump knows this or is he really that stupid? Apparently he is not a stupid man, but im beginning to wonder about that. Also why hasn&#39;t someone corrected him and told him the phrase is ;Rare Earth Minerals;? is everyone so scared of him that they will not correct him? Over and over again he said it. The reporters don&#39;t even corner him in conversations, isn&#39;t he answerable to the people for his actions? if he is asked questions unless its a matter of national securty etc. questions should be addressed and answered! time and time again he yells and carry&#39;s on like a spoilt child to shut down conversations. That should not be tolerated someone without fear and with the gift of the gab (speaks well for those who are unfamiliar with the expression) should interview him on camera and put him in his place and belittle him for a change, and teach him some humility. Trump is a bully! and if anyone is showing signs of being a dictator he is! If WW3 happens Trump and Putin they wont be the ones doing the fighting they will be sitting somewhere safe, while your homes are being bombed and your children are fighting and dying. Both of them make me sick to the stomach. Americans and Russians both should be doing all they can to get them both out of power.

For the hundreds of billions of dollars American taxpayers have given him and his country, of which some of it is unaccounted for, Zelensky should be effusive with his praise. I think he did say thanks once or twice, but it was muted. Zelensky saying Europe has been very giving compared to the U.S. was embarrassing.
Trump saying in 2014 or 2015 he wasn&#39;t there he already made it clear that he wss talking about other Presidents. Zelensky had to humble himself and bite his tongue. Trump and Vance didnt have to embarrass hom like this.

When you turn down a cease fire to start peace talks.... when you openly say you do not want dialogue...  you are telling the world you do not want peace.

Even when Trump pointed out he is bringing the world to the brink of another world war he pulled faces and raised his eyes and still wanted money.  2 war mongers, Putin &amp; Zelensky..both with massive egos and one as bad as each other.

and he got the right too because Z disrespected the country that gave him 400 Billions and the country that try to save hi and stop the war as trump said ;you are nt winning this;
Zelensky doesn‚Äôt want peace. Full stop.
He claims to be the best POTUS jokingly, but we all know he really thinks this highly of himself because he NEEDS his ego to be stroked...this makes him weak and an embarrassment!
This is how conversations should be. A good conversation should allow emotions to surface, even when discussing big issues. Diplomatic slushing is not part of honest speech. Great Trump, great Zele!
All was going well, until JD Vans started talking rubbish.
It‚Äôs disheartening to see some Americans supporting Zelensky, a dictator who has stolen billions of our taxpayer dollars.
He wants to leave no stone unturned to protect the lives and freedom of the citizens of his country. Any other questions?

Zelinsky is something else. He&#39;s a prime example of letting your mouth write checks that your ass can&#39;t cash. After watching zelinsky in this he&#39;s not interested in anything but WWIII. Facts are without USA and our money Ukraine will be Russia&#39;s. He should be very thankful for ANYTHING USA does ATP. Personally i don&#39;t think we should send one more cent, weapon, or military personnel there.
The only man in that room is president Zelensky!
The one time I wished I WASN&#39;T in the room where it happened.
All things considered, I can say that it&#39;s an honor to be able to listen to this.  Directly as it happens.  The American people have been relegated to the sidelines for far too long.  Just listening makes me feel a part of the process, a part of this country.   Good luck Ukraine, take the deal.
Very revealing to watch all of it. Zelensky started sermonizing and hijacked the event starting <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1290">21:30

Trump handled this meeting really well, but his man Vance let him down.  I&#39;ve seen nothing to suggest Vance has the diplomacy skills that the job commands, but i&#39;ve faith Trump will spot and fix that early.

When it comes to Rare Earth In the Ukraine. Tell me, do you think that these people died for their land not so that it could be given to Putin or so that it could be given to the United States of America, but so that it could be for the people of the Ukraine.If they have a commodity that we want, and Russia, once let them process, it, let them make the money off of it let the people who died and we‚Äôre dying for their land. Keep their land.If we want it, let them process it distribute it, and the world can pay a fair price And I don‚Äôt think anything less would be fair
American arrogance at it&#39;s best. They can talk but others cannot. JD Vance must watch his mouth and also understands that Zelenski cannot speak English that well and cannot express himself. Listen, allow hiom his frustrations and don&#39;t try to tell him off. Goodness, what is wrong with the Trump administration. A WW 3 will because of Trumps stupidity and not Ukraine or Russia!
It&#39;s clear to me that Zelensky don&#39;t ubderstand the mediation posstion the US is taking. Trump has sated clearly that he&#39;s ob Ucraine&#39;s side but that ht he&#39;s doing is try to stop the carnage. The only world&#39;s leader thst has shown concer for life.Zelenski&#39;s stubborn abour Putin&#39;s unreliability but that press conference wasn&#39;t the place to insisti on that.He should have stuck to the actual agreements reached and allowed the negotiations proceed to see where it leads.Whay he has done is to weaken the US government&#39;s initiative.I undestand the Ucraine&#39;s ambassador reaction.Whay Zelensky must do is decide if he&#39;s for peace fir Ukraine or if he&#39;s to keep on war forever.
Europe, including Ukraine, has 2.6 million soldiers, the USA has 1.3 million, China has 2 million soldiers, and Russia has 1.1 million. According to the same source, Europe has 2,091 fighters, the USA - 1,456, China - 1,409 and Russia - 1,224.
Both president n his VP r jerk!!
@@TheWorldsOkayestUSMarine Hmm, guess you haven&#39;t a clue about Putin&#39;s goals, Russian history, or Ukrainian history. I DO. And I don&#39;t care about your foolish and silly black and white or color perspective idea. Putin has made it quite plain what he believes and intends on doing. As to JD Vance, he has had quite a few opportunities to prove he is a clueless and obnoxious fool. This was not the first time. As to your global scale, right now, the administration is giving autocrats around the world quite a bit of shade.  You think giving Putin what he wants is good on a global scale? Seriously? You would have fit right in with the views of the last ;American First; movement. They almost made us lose WWII. If the Japanese hadn&#39;t been stupid enough to attack Pearl Harbor, they wanted to toss Great Britain into Hitler&#39;s claws. History is dangerously close to that rhyme, and it isn&#39;t Zelenskyy&#39;s fault. It is the cowards and appeasers. And yes, Trump is braggart and a bully, but he is also a coward. He is the one who cut the Afghan government out of negotiations with the Taliban and engineered the fiasco that Biden got stuck with.;It never woulda happened...; Bullshit, Trump sets up the disasters. He didn&#39;t do a thing when Xi was crushing local democracy (as per treaty) in Hong Kong. He just bragged about how peaceful the world was when he didn&#39;t do anything to thwart North Korea or Iran&#39;s actual goals. Worse yet, to make himself feel good, he lies about what others did or didn&#39;t do and inflates whatever he did and claims almost anything that  went well as his doing when he had nothing to do with it. As an example of that, he claimed he came up with the ideas of how to destroy ISIS when it was Gen Brown, the officer he just fired in favor of a General that had never had strategic command position.

Across the world we witnessed vice  president deflecting when he shows himself being ignorant of the previous  diplomatic  meeting which failed and he was unwilling to learn why  and choosing to talk manners and gratitude I dont for a minute think hes unaware of how grateful he after all he bought weapons and then told ge coukdnt use them  Well President Trump Then talking over himHow rude.This is going to be what has Donald Trump agreed to do with the spoils of war in diving Ukraine up between them for personal gain

Note that it isn&#39;t Zelenskyy that is risking WWIII. It is Trump and his foolish honoring and appeasement of thugs. Actually, Zelenskyy wanted the arms that would have finished off the ability of Putin&#39;s war machine to invade Ukraine or , by default, prevent Putin from exercising his other territorial dreams of conquest. Ukraine was on the way to that until the Republicans seem to decide that Putin needed a hand, crying about what in military expenditures, is actually fairly mild for what is really a large modern war. What Zelenskyy was trying to convey was that Putin cannot be trusted and has far grander territorial goals. Appease Putin and coddle him and play up to him and it will just encourage him to get to keep what he has stolen so far. As Putin will, according to this set of appeasers has virtually promised, get to be rid of sanctions, have no retribution and be able to raise money to build a better military, he will have another go at Ukraine and other points west. It is not Ukraine that wants this war to go on. It is Putin, with a defanged Ukraine, so he can march right in, like they did in Crimea. And like they did in Poland with four partitions of that country. And the parts of Eastern Europe that we actually liberated from the Nazis during WWII, only, by pre-arranged agreements, which we honored, gave the areas, such as most of what would be East Germany, to the Soviets. The Soviets said they would allow free and fair elections throughout Eastern Europe as part of the agreements. They lied. They very quickly sent in the Red Army and used former Nazis to subjugate the people and deny any free and fair elections.

@@dbk9761That&#39;s an absurd lie. The independent Kiel Institute calculated that the US gave 120 billion usd to Ukraine, while Europe gave them almost 140 billion usd. Also Europe has promised it will gave a lot more.That&#39;s a total lie by trump
@@BarbaraG-bs8bp thats not true at all. Germany supplied couple of their patriot missiles and aintiar defense system with rockets, Nasams anti air defense. Supplied their old and some amount of new leopard two tanks. Some bullet based antiair defense systems, handheld antitank weapons and so on and so forth. Germany could have done more but they don&#39;t have nukes and are scared of Russia unlike France, UK and USA. Also Germany helped a lot of Ukrainian refugees, paid them financial help and housed them. It was mostly woman with children, not working age males.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!

You explained this so well, thank you!
It looks like Trump thinks he can control Europe and Ukraine with a few words, but I actually think he&#39;s oversimplifying it
You don&#39;t have the guts, with us you have the guts ü§î

Stupid reporter asking why Zellensky not wearing a suit.. why didn‚Äôt u ask why Elon Musk not wearing a suit it Oval Office past week, more importantly brought his son..
@@phucphucgames7897Given Trump&#39;s rhetoric in the past days and his general attitute towards Ukraine and Russia, who would trust even an oral agreement for security let alone an IMPLIED one. For all anybody can see, the much more realistic result of this agreement is that once Ukraine stop fighting, Putin&#39;d start preparing a new assault force and Trump would denounce any such attempts by Ukraine. Then Putin would conquer Ukraine and in the end the mineral rights agreement wouldn&#39;t even be respected so the US wouldn&#39;t even gain anything other than losing an ally.
But achieved a very bad outcome lol
Like a fkn hyenas, jumping on the man, talking loud horse shit! Selenskyj should‚Äôve punch this squash head in his fkn cabbage!

@@jonathanvales4635 No!!! We haven&#39;t given or provided anywhere near that much. That is Trump inflation. Try $182 billion in TOTAL of all kinds of aid.  Using the same categories of aid, Europe has, indeed, provided more aid. When separating out military aid, Europe has still provided more aid. And if we had stuck with it, it would have been worth it, but Trump,  and most Republicans - who cut arms funding to Ukraine for almost a year,  they all want Putin to win.We have actually gotten a bargain. We got to provide old military material that got field tested against an actual enemy without having to put our own troops at risk. We gained valuable information from our interactions with Ukraine. We are getting to replace it with improved weapons in new stocks. Some of what we supplied, such as missiles, were nearing their replacement dates. We got to curb the territorial goals of a thug who has made it quite plain since the mid 1990&#39;s that he wants to reconstitute the largest extent of the Russian Empire. He has particular fixations on Ukraine (obviously), Poland, Finland, and the Baltic States. Russia and the Soviet Union have severely abused and enslaved the residents of every place that they have invaded. They have never deserved any dominion over Eastern Europe due to their severe abuse of the people and draining of their economic wealth. I just wonder if you ever saw what East Germany was like after 40 years of Soviet occupation. Unlike West Germany, which was rebuilt and prospered, the Russians left many areas of East Germany and all the other ;satellite states; with the ravages of WWII.

South Africa needs to return the billion. Have a seat beggar
@@rw2452 You&#39;re right and I think even Zelensky would agree with you. Without American and European support, Ukraine is up the river without a paddle.I&#39;d have to give a long answer, but here&#39;s the short version: to Ukraine any peace deal without establishing long-term peace just kicks the can down the road. It means Russia will have time to recover all its losses and attack again in a few years and repeat until Ukraine is finally conquered. A long-term plan is possible - but only if the US is willing to help.And for their one card: they&#39;ve impressively held out against Russia and have been bleeding it dry. Russia&#39;s 3 day operation is now going on 3 years. They have maintained the US-led world order, kept Eastern Europe intact, and helped with US strategic interests (blocking a new USSR from forming, discouraging China from attacking Taiwan, etc.) at a relatively low cost.

Americans just want to own land, dig out resources, exploiting Ukraine, they just want to finance the war, while stealing the resources. They don&#39;t care about peace. A Money hungry nation. No deal, if the are no securities thats what the Ukrainian Presitent is fighting for, Trump is all talk but no action!!!!
To those who think Zelensky isn&#39;t ungrateful, watch <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2695">44:55 again.;From the very beginning of the war, we&#39;ve been alone.; That is a blatant lie. Without foreign aid, things wouldn&#39;t have turned out well for them at all. If that foreign aid means nothing to him, he should continue the war without it.He can say that diplomacy with Putin doesn&#39;t work all day long, but A: that&#39;s not true and B: it will end in an unimaginable tragedy if this war isn&#39;t ended diplomatically.But, let&#39;s say hypothetically, if he truly believes what he&#39;s saying there, then why does he even bother at all with negotiations? Just hand Ukraine over to Putin and be done with it, because that&#39;s the second best alternative to a diplomatic solution when it concerns the actual Ukranian people. The other two alternatives would be A: a Russian victory in the war, which is the same end result with a lot more destruction and death preceding it and also a lot less favorable terms, or B: a Ukranian ;victory; where Russia is defeated, but if you actually manage to corner Putin into military defeat, what do you think is going to happen? He may well press ;the button; as a last resort and that&#39;s something we all want to avoid.That&#39;s what Trump means when he says that Zelensky doesn&#39;t have the cards to negotiate that. It&#39;s a position of complete delusion.

JD Vance is the guy, who started to escalate that with saying things about disrespect. What an asshole!!! Is this really, how the negotiations should look like?
Prior to this meeting Trump lied and said Ukraine starte this war and called Zelensky a dictator. He was impeached of asking Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden. And Zelensky said Trump was manipulated by Russian misinformation.Reporter: What do you say to people that think you align yourself too much with Putin?Trump: I align myself with everyone to make a deal. I align myself with no one. I care about America. Europe. The world. Just inconstant word salad to get himself out of the question as if he has a clue what he&#39;s talking about.Vance, trying to defend Trump and kiss up and spin alignment: We aren&#39;t aligning ourselves with Putin because we had a bad President before this (Bad President = anyone who is not Trump) who never tried Diplomacy.¬†This exposes just how ingorant JD Vance is on foreign policy and history with Russia.Zelensky (who has been making this point all throughout the meeting reiterates that has been tried and doesn&#39;t work: We have already signed cease fires, he has violted them repeatedly.Vance gets defensive that somone questions him and points out his ignorance and basically says, don&#39;t question us and show respect and gratitude or we will not help you and says did you say thanks this whole meeting. He did at the start. He attacks Zelensky saying you have problems without us. Zelensky questions what Vance really knows and invites him to come see for himself.Vance doubles down on his defensiveness and inexperience  and responds with: I watched it on TV or Twitter or YT and calls Zelensky a propgandist, without the slightest bit of self awareness and irony.Trump gets defensive and dips into his only well, everything before didn&#39;t work and he broke ceasefires because I was not President and that was the only problem. Trump was president for some of that period and ceasefires were broken.Reporter asks what makes you so sure that Putin will not break a cease fire considering he has done it over 25 times over 11 years even while you were President?Trump exposes his real and only foreign policy, it will work because I&#39;m President and everyone respects me, and only me. And the respect for me will prevent it. This is child like thinking made up in his head. And since this meeting Trump has alienated all of America&#39;s allies that we&#39;ve built over decades in less than a month. Because the do not respect him or trust him. The opposite of what he believes and claims. And astounding and rapid destruction in of years of work in a short period of time.He also spends most of this meeting attacking his opposition candidates and rehashing his insecurities of being attacked during the campaign. He won the election and instead of spending time governing he believes he&#39;s still in the campaign. Reporter: What happens if he breaks it.Trump: Dimisses the question because Trump has no plan. His plan is that his mere prescense is the solution to everything. Trump has put America in an isolated and vulnerable position and the world in a destabilized one.

@michaelayo1953  how hard is it for Trump to admit that Putin is a murderous psychopathic dictator who needs to be stopped? How hard is it for Trump to admit that Putin started this war by invading Ukraine, and therefore Putin is 100% at fault? Trump is a spineless coward who can&#39;t admit to either of those facts. He must like sucking Putin&#39;s dick too much. The deal he was trying to get signed would have given the US an extreme amount of Ukraine&#39;s natural mineral wealth in exchange for only the promise of peace, with no security guarantees. We all know that Putin&#39;s and Trump&#39;s word is worth jack shit. Why on Earth would Zelensky take that deal?

@bendraper87¬† Zelinsky is also not a psychic and has no right trying to tell the president who will or will not be a problem for the US. By doing so, he is implying that we as a nation would not be able to deal with Russia if they ever tried. Zelinsky said that as a scare and intimidation tactic. Trying to scare the president into not negotiating with Russia so we would give them more support or a better position in the negotiations so he could win and go home and play big hero.

Zelensky was disagreeable and uncooperative with everything JD and Trump said. We‚Äôre extending our hand to save his country and he has the nerve to say we will have a war with Russia in the future? You don‚Äôt have the cards. Take what they‚Äôre giving you, if Trump can work out a ceasefire with Putin you‚Äôd be an idiot not to take it considering your country is surviving on our assistance.
&#39;Raw earth&#39; ? What the hell is this clown talking about?
I would have slapped the not-sees
You can tell 90% of the commenters here have zero idea about how all this started, about the 2014 coup of Ukraine to install a puppet government led by the CIA, to Bidens dealings with Burisma, to NATOs creep since 1990 ever closer to Russias border despite saying they won&#39;t move one inch east of east Berlin, to the real cause of the war, which is to control Europes energy market. This is why Biden blew up the Nordsteam pipeline.  Yet so many comments here are so confident whos the baddy here.  Give me a fkn break, maybe it&#39;s Trump derangement syndrome.  Maybe it&#39;s years of propaganda and not changing the tv channel or thinking critically.  Maybe it&#39;s bots.  Maybe it&#39;s just retards?

I believe that Donald Trump and J.D Vance said what was needed to be said to Zelenskyj.He deserved to be informed about reality, Zelenskyj has received far too much air under his wings so to speak.When you, as a guest, come to the oval room and do not show the respect , especially when you meet D.Trump and J.D Vance, you deserve a reminder of it, just as both Donald Trump and J.D Vance pointed out in their own way.
poor Ukrainas ambasador....
Zelensky claims Putin took parts of the east in 2014: Not true. That puts killed people: Not true. Not a single person lost their lives when the people of Crimea voted to reunite with Russia. But during this time Ukraine was shelling innocent people in the Donbass.

Wow, I‚Äôve never seen a president speak so much at a meeting with another president and especially whilst sharing the stage with a newly elected president who doesn‚Äôt care to share the limelight. This war is about natural resources and nothing more. Their neighbours want to keep it close and others don‚Äôt want that to happen and are willing to help on a count of them sharing those resources if they help them. This isn‚Äôt a brutal war, there‚Äôs no genocide involved, plain and simple we need access to those resources if we help is what‚Äôs being said. A lot of car production slowed down severely because of this war over resources because they make car chips that are needed in production. They also make a lot of other small yet very important components to other parts for other industries.

I think trump pretty much lost his chance of getting rare earth minerals. What a childish boob
JD is a pompous,  rude, bottom  licking, agitator riding on the Trump train. I‚Äôd be embarrassed to be associated to such a phallic head! Oh and did I mention‚Ä¶..a condescending twat? They treated zelensky as a norty little boy!
unfortunately Zelensky is a liar. How can Putin break 27 agreements since 2014? Russia had no agreement with Ukraine regarding the Donbass. The Mink agreements were agreements between the people of the Donbass and Ukraine, Russia was an observer, as was France and Germany. Zelensky broke all of those agreements, and kept murdering his own people. 14, 000, mostly women and children. The people of the Donbass pleaded with Russia for eight long years for help.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Trump and Vance definitely had this all choreographed and  ambushed him from his arrival at the Whitehouse, with his clothing remark. Trumps Stooge reporter brought it up again at the meeting... setting Zelensky up for the ambush proper. The stooge wasn&#39;t there when Elon Musk was in the Cabinet Office in his T Shirt and Baseball Cap, strangely.I was starting to enjoy Trump. But his, and Vances humiliation of a country&#39;s President   who is striving to save his country from a real Tyrant, was disgraceful We, UK, Europe, do not need him. Really, we don&#39;t.

Just another example of the Incompetents and under-educated people Americans voted into the Whitehouse!

It was surprisingly diplomatic until JD jumped in just for shits and giggles
Remember Earthling , not all opinions on social media are worth your energy. Focus on what uplifts and informs you!
Poor Zelenskyy came to talk about his people dying like flies and all Trump wants to do is talk about Biden. Please Mr Trump we are all aware you won, it‚Äôs over now so time to move on. We all realize how great you are so can we change the subject now please
@@jonathanvales4635The U.S. has given around 120 billion most of which was reinvested into the U.S. The U.S. spent about $30 billion on some kind of aid. And then the USA replenished its own arms (for about $50 billion) and gave the old stuff to Ukraine (depreciated, it cost about $18 billion). That&#39;s $48 billion worth of money/stuff that Ukraine received.You are a victim of disinformation. The U.S. hasn‚Äôt sent anywhere near 300 billion.
I&#39;m trying to watch this I really am but he makes me so sick.
Oh my god, this is hard to watch. Poor Z! How trite and extremely insensitive T is to say ;they don&#39;t like each other, this is not a love match;. You can see Z struggling to master his outrage and disbelief. He&#39;s just told T that Putin doesn&#39;t recognise his country and wants to destroy it, the Ukrainian language, culture, infrastructure....and then he blames Biden for Putin&#39;s crimes! Trump says ;my whole life is deals; - how very sad. And Putin had to ;suffer; through the Russia hoax??? Does T even recognise a despot when he sees one? ;You see the hatred this guy has for Putin?; Shocking. Putin invaded his country and is trying to destroy it. And then Vance says Trump is engaging in diplomacy...right before he shows his true colours. As soon as Z offers a real questioning of the diplomacy and American attitude, Vance becomes a bully and not only tries to shut him down, he insults him. Trump should have stopped this, right at this point, before it escalated in front of millions. Not diplomacy, not skillful, but reckless beyond belief.
Raw earth?
Why does it matter that Zelensky doesn&#39;t wear a suit. I think it&#39;s great that he downplay himself into being in line with his people that are fighting. It matters that he cares about his people. That was a stupid question. Who cares?
I hate this grifter you Reichwing morons call your president! He didn&#39;t care one iota about the Ukrainians. Fucking disgusting!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Less than 60 seconds in Trump talks about digging digging digging.
If the US would get invaded men like Vance would give up their country for free. Omg, what happened to the US.
A one retarded whos thing own the world
Vance&#39;s question: ;HAVE YOU SAID THANK YOU ONCE  IN THIS ENTIRE MEETING?*I counted them. Zelenski said thank you AT LEAST 6 times during the entire meeting .
Agreement was broken by NATO and U.S not Russia go and have a taste of history guys
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
@Axel_Andersen¬† you need to check the state department website there buddy because 350 billion has been given in weapons, military aid, NATO aid for surrounding countries, USAID aid, and other methods since the invasion for Crimea. So, no lies are coming from over this way. If you want the link, I&#39;ll be more than happy to provide it, and that&#39;s just a rough estimate as I don&#39;t have time to sit here like a member of DOGE and crunch all the numbers. Those are just the number the state department is reporting. That don&#39;t include any funding given to their government by unknown sources within the US like the CIA either.
For everyone, who tries to protect Zelensky.He is betrayer of his country. He doesn&#39;t want to stop this war. Because war is only thing that helps him to stay as president. If war ends, he ends up in jail. And he know it.
Mr. Z redeemed himself  around 31 mins on in he&#39;s catching on.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
An epic and most monumental breakdown and failure on the level of negotiations and strategic communication:  Do not go to the press unless and until there is smoke blowing from the chimney (consensus).  Both parties failed themselves and each other here. Zelensky&#39;s face and frustration, at minute 19, foretold what was to come. Vance was in no position to address Zelensky, as a junior to the latter&#39;s counterpart - who was present.But Putin loved, I bet, every minute of this. Europe, the US and Ukraine are not singing from the same hymn.
Here is the true face of Ukraine ..... illiteracy, shortsightedness ... and is unconditionally hysterism. Zelensky&#39;s way !!  You brought your country to collapse !!!  You come to the property in Europe.  Soking the money from his people ... Twal Zadoga buys jewelry for a lot of money .... Desposite Zelensky ... sting the people of Ukraine !!
for sure, not so big as your mom
Trump was very half assed about this meeting. Totally unprepared. What a mediocre effort on the part of America. And now trump has screwed up his raw earth minerals. What an incompetent boob

Zelensky doesn&#39;t like this deal and wants to continue negotiating in front of the cameras.  Trump thinks the deal has been arranged.  This is the standard press conference at which both leaders are supposed to smile and say nice things to build each other up.  Zelensky should have made sure he was satisfied with their deal before he agreed to this public meeting.  He&#39;s appearing to back out on it in front of the cameras, which makes Trump look foolish, which is guaranteed to undo whatever deal they thought they had agreed to.  Zelensky is far too accustomed to playing the rock star to fawning U.S. and European left-wing diplomats and Congress members and getting constant supplies of new money and weapons.  He thinks he can dictate more than he can and doesn&#39;t want peace if it means compromises.  He thinks the U.S. will win his war for him.  Trump is too realistic to attempt that.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!

@gavindegan¬† imperialism? Are you kidding me? This administration doesn&#39;t want to stake a claim to Ukraine. We just want our money back, and since their GDP can&#39;t afford to give us our money back, we accept payment in raw earth minerals. We aren&#39;t making Ukraine take our money and equipment they asked us for help because capitalism, although at times flawed, is still the best economy system in the world.
Imagine you are in a competition with someone for something.. say ‚Äòmiss america‚Äô ‚Ä¶A ‚Äòbig name‚Äô guy then decided to run campaigns and stuff for your opponent but you managed to win. Now this guy needs your help only you can render due to your victory. Will this help be on your terms or the guy‚Äôs terms? Would love to get a response .
How helpless you are when your country is invaded and bullied, and people want to take advantage of you. There is no civilization in this world. There are only more villains like Trump. Hell is empty and the devil is in the world.
And see Trump reassuringly wink at the reporter who asked the trivial and insensitive question about why Z doesn&#39;t wear a suit? Maybe that reporter should have done his research first. It&#39;s a mark of a leader whose country is at war.
;thank you mr president;10 minutes later;why didnt you say thank you for anything?;
@@jonathanvales4635 Lies are strong with you. You gave nothing like that figure. All reliable source says EU gave more, but both gave about the same. And US sent old equipment, refreshed and replenished their own stockpiles with the money they &#39;gave&#39; to Ukraine.
Trump is right. Selensky only sees an end to the war if Putin is gone. That would mean total war and world war 3. Putin can not be trusted, this is true. But by going on like this, Ukraine will be destroyed. If a Trump strikes a deal there will be an end to this, at least for a time. If Putin tries anything again in the future, it is not know. But Europe can prepare. Our defence is embarrassing. And as Trump said, we have to increase our budget. I don&#39;t understand people in the comments with their stupid Trump hating. The guy tries to negotiate a deal. It is a tough situation. He also said that it is hard to talk to Selensky, since he is afraid of Putin. Right so. This is not an easy task, but Selenskys option is to fight on. Putin will survive this but not Ukraine. He won&#39;t manage to drain Russia&#39;s resources that easily, even with western military aid. This is the start of a new cold war.
They dont need to say thank you to the f face Vice President. They have the cards you idiot, e.g.. France, Italy Germany, Australia, Japanese, Vietnam, Taiwan....you American will look like a idiot.
@troll65667so you have no brain?
You first need the cease fire then enforcement, but it seems you all are losing track of the real deal Mr zelensky is a proud man. He honestly thinks he is asking for what is in his country&#39;s best interest, but no person should break protocol and dress like he&#39;s just hanging out. He stood his ground without all his power backers in place, a bad tactical move that caused his people to much suffering. He has good intentions but Patton would have had him court-martialed for such a poor move. It was a dirty meeting but it shows that Trump will roll up his sleeves and not pull a political dance a round.  Note I am not a person who likes Mr. Trump &#39;but he sounds logical and braggadocios.

captain hindsight and a hero
Putin is very very happy watching this. I think Putin is playin US and Trump like Stalin played allies in Jalta. Trump thinks he&#39;s special and Putin will honour their deal, this makes me laugh. The Russians are very sly, they think longterm and for now the deal is in their interest but they wont hesitate to brake it when they will smell they are ready to take something more. Trump is delusional to think otherwise.
What trump did towards the end btw is what any big brother will do.. even if the younger one is somewhat wrong. And rightfully so.. how do you campaign for a party that lost and now looking for favors from the other party that won?
Problems they can never comprehend? Fuck out of here. War isn&#39;t anything new, i think what you mean is problems they never have to face, and they never have to face it cause no one in the world wants smoke with the US. The last country that did got to get slapped around for 20 years till we got board fucking it up. Dont you dare sit there though and act like America hasn&#39;t been involved or had to deal with almost every single conflict since the end of WW2.

;President Zelenskyy, you have worked hard. Russia, with its immense military power, has needlessly subjected you and your people to suffering. In your time of vulnerability, even the two highest American leaders who verbally champion freedom, peace, and truth have jointly disrespected and humiliated you like bandit chiefs, which is shocking to see.

The orange fool is talking about peace and the enormous number of victims of the war so I wonder why the greatest pacifist in the world doesn&#39;t start peace in his own country by dismanteling his army and donate all the weaponry to Ukraine,  peacefulness starts from within Buddha once said and then see if China and Russia will respect that because it&#39;s the nice mr.trump.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Good work France&#39;s primeter
USA government don&#39;t need a Ukraine history viewpoint,it&#39;s about a minerals deal,take contract home review it,again
So tragic it ended like this. Praying they will cool off and be willing to work out a deal.
Trump is honest
Wrong, because Trump didn&#39;t threaten he even said if an agreement couldn&#39;t be reached we as a nation would still support Ukraine, but he would rather reach an agreement, whereas Zelinsky being the stubborn ass he is decided that unless he got everything he wanted he was not willing to agree to anything. That&#39;s not how negotiations work.

All zelenkay can say is thankyou instead of cease fire, a sof aitting on throne leaves it to fetch the bones, he ruined ukraine
You explained this so well, thank you!
One thing that I never understood about this whole situation, and one thing that seems to be a constant in the Pro-Russia/Trump crowd, is this. Why does Russia have a monopoly on morality? Why is it Ukraine that has to surrender to Russia? Why does Ukraine have to make concessions to Russia? Why do the Ukrainian people need to unjustly suffer while Russia keeps pulling this nuclear saber rattling? This interview looks like a premeditated political ambush and as an American it sickens me to see this play out. Even more so when I learned that the AP and Reuters were barred from showing up but TASS-the Russian State Media- was allowed access momentarily. You can see the look on Zelenskyy&#39;s face when he&#39;s hearing all of this being said and how he-while being bombarded with Kremlin talking points- wants to clap back with truthful statements instead of the fabrications that trump and vance are pushing and how all of this is just a giant disgrace to this nation. As an American who cares about this country and the ideals it was founded upon, I can only see one solution.Donald ;The Tangerine Turncoat; Trump has got to go so that he can no longer make America look like a fool on the world stage and cause more death and destruction than he already has.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
who the f*ck is actually the president, is it dj vancea, or nazi musk? never seen a president of the united state or any other country interrupted like that ‚Ä¶.such a disgrace for this country, i feel for those who understand what happened, and for those who support a free world
@ I‚Äôm great. Don‚Äôt you just think it‚Äôs crazy that we‚Äôve sent 300 billion tax payer dollars to Ukraine. And that clown has the audacity to refuse a peace deal? Kinda pisses me off
Yh jd messed this up. Shouldn‚Äôt even have opened his santa looking ass mouth.
Whats with all the fake comments???
Thank you for sharing the full interview.Zelensky is never on the same level of U.S neither Russian diplomates, tbh his gestures and moves can annoy everyone!Feel sorry for the nation of Ukraine they must have seen it coming when they chose a delusional Clown as a president. Liked U.S act from üáÆüá∑
Idk whats President Zelenskyy&#39;s exact reason, neither do I know him, but its up to him to convey his message. A simple suit isnt expensive at all. If he doesnt dress for the particular scenario, its up to him to convey the message why.And if he doesnt, its up to him too.To the simpletons, its not as though youre in a kindergarten and one kid points to the other saying ;why me;.The event, type of people, and hierarchy, etc.When you go for an interview you have you dress higher than your boss not lesser.In different country, different cultures. If youre invited to a western wedding, you dont go there in slippers.So many appropriate things to consider, showing an effort on your end, showing the basic respect.
What an absolute disgrace. I‚Äôm disgusted.
this is an invasion by a nuclear power on a much smaller country, don&#39;t call it war, UA was invaded by Russia, facts matter. All those young men (and women!!!) are dying because of Putin.
Great discussion from US ! üëèüëè

The smirks in his face smh you&#39;re there for some help to make peace yet make faces. He also shakes his head when Trump says America has put in a lot more than Europe, thats what the records say, it was always a headline when the US gave funds
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
stfu America is the only country thst should be worried about.
Interview was downright disrespectful and unprofessional
Zelensky isn&#39;t in a strong posistion.  Of course he wants guarantees.  What he should want is peace for his country.  He lost, he going to have to make some concessions in exchange for peace.  That is the garantee

I had a different option about Trump..but slowly slowly it looks that he doesn&#39;t realy care about stopping the war because it&#39;s bad, looks that he&#39;s ready to step on bodies to get where he wants
He said flat out it will be a problem for us. If we were face to face and i said if you don&#39;t walk away from me right now, there will be a problem for you, you&#39;re gonna see that as a treat. Period.

Zelensky never said he didn&#39;t want a cease fire. He said that Putin has broken a cease fire 25 times in the past, even with other countries standing behind Ukraine. And yes, even during Trump&#39;s first presidency. All he wants is a concrete plan for what will be done if Putin breaks a cease fire again.

You people who think that because JD and Trump havent been on ground doesnt know anything forgets that we have the FUCKING BEST intelligence gather network in the world, the most safisticated satellites in the world, and the best communication systems in the world. Both of these men get daily updates and briefings every single day. They dont have to be there to know whats going on you retards. Smh. I mean, really, some of you people are absolutely ridiculous. Zalinsky needs to eat a big fat piece of humble pie and remember that if we were to back out of this war, it would be a wrap for them. We have been holding up his country and regime since the annex of Crimea. So he should put on a fucking suite, and be a fucking presdient, and quit acting like he is a solider on the front line. Then maybe, just maybe, if he acted like a president, Putin wouldn&#39;t have made the moves he did. But instead he goes into one of the most respected offices in the world and has the audacity to try and grand stand and tell the top officials of the strongest and most funded country in the world they dont know what their talkong about. Fuck out of here. The utter disrespect for the office of president, lack of professionalism, and inability to maintain his composure makes me sick.

@@rw2452 To be accurate: Zelensky said peace talks and ceasefires alone are not enough.Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014. Got a ceasefire, restrengthened its army, and then attacked again in 2022. They&#39;ve broken TWENTY-FIVE ceasefires in that time. And that&#39;s not counting the deal in 1994 where Ukraine gave up their nukes after US and Russian guarantees of safety.Not to mention the many other countries Russia has made peace deals with and then openly violated. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s wrong to say Russia can&#39;t be trusted to obey ceasefires - especially if your goal is lasting peace.
What did the  EU give? Lol!!!
How are you going to attempt to negotiate with a party Trump who has lost the war to Russia do you think that your proposal is even valid as US Dollars cost Russian life Putin will never honor this amatuer deal this seriously the pride of a fool .   The only party you should be talking to is the winner of the war and the original king of Ukraine the land of Ukraine has always been russias .    The power and clout the US once had is no longer .   That iron and clay feet have been divided and shattered holding on to it just hurts the remaining good people your leadership is amatuer hour truly straight rookies.

;If you don&#39;t do that, this will happen to you; is a threat. Trying to intimidate the other party into doing something against their will. Coercion is the term.
Like the minerals you seek are going to the hands of the Americans Vladimir Putin now owns this country and it was originally Russia‚Äôs so it is his to take .     Ukraine is under the bear always has been the son of man will discuss options with Russia in private .   For now WW3 is commanded to start unless Esau the whore steps off the throne they are drunk on the saints of the righteous and the lion of Judah will bring them low
President Volodymyr Zelensky has my full respect. Staying this calm while being attacked by the braindead JD Vance, the orange monkey und his minions (there&#39;s a right of free speach, right?) is unbelievable. Best decision ever to not make any deals with criminals!
Zalensky can lie
Zelensky makes it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want to end war. For not having enough arms, tech and man power, Zelensky thinks it‚Äôs American and European obligation to fight for Ukrain. This is neither diplomacy nor warring strategy to continue fighting till you burn your last straw. If Ukrain has its narrative, so does Russia. Negotiation is when both sides are heard, reasoned with and agreed to. Zelensky calling Putin killer and terrorist;  betting on the US/ EU aid, and his aimless warmongering at this moment will go down in history as the stupidest thing any statesman could imagine.
I don&#39;t care what your opinion of President Trump is, but he cares about human life. Those are sons, and fathers dying on the battle fields of Ukraine. He actually cares about the young men on both sides. They all have a right, given by God to live a full life... They should not give up such a precious gift as life to a pointless cause! Please! End this awful war!!!!!

Not like this meeting even has any revelance the reality is Zelensky is offered a deal by a Vance and Trump but the deal is not even enforceable by either party as Russia now fully owns and controls Ukraine .    Trump is attempting to flex his clout on other nations but the reality is his throne is being overthrown by the Heavenly Father as he will in pride refuse to move he will be forcefully removed from the power seat our lord returned today and is now the cheif in command of righteousness glory will be to the most high and his son the king the lion of Judah and who was ushered in from the heavens and now has divided Satan we have a new king the son of man who is overthrowing the throne of esau he loosened the scrools and will be ruling with a iron fist against Esau so no pedafiles or child or murders of imnocent life are allowed to be in power in any jurisdiction but the prince of Persia the bear and the prince of Asia can bring wrath to the throne of Esau .

‚Ä¶??
Thanks for the transparency
Trump supporter here but I can be honest and say that Trump goes 5 steps forward to go 6 back at times.. Zelensky seemed frustrated at times because he was trying to say things and the reporters were asking stupid questions and not letting him speak after Trump was done. He did not seem ungrateful at all, vance started this notion that zelensky was ungrateful. So TrumpFelt he had to show his power too and feed off of what Vance started . Zelensky was trying make a point that the ceasefire was not honored in the past so how will they have a guarantee that Putin won‚Äôt do it again . Vance took it the wrong way. Zelensky started saying thank you since he arrived from when he met trump outside when he got dropped off. I felt second hand embarrassment for us. They down spoke to Zelensky and I don‚Äôt feel it was a good move on our part. That is not a strong leader quality like supporters think it was. It was wrong and should have never been publicized. Think it was a miscommunication thing because I don‚Äôt think zelensky was saying anything wrong. It was escalated because Vance didn‚Äôt understand that zelensky was trying to make a point. I can admit that they were wrong with this one. Very disappointing.
Zelinsky didn&#39;t thank America for the help is part of what ticked off Vance. The other is Zelinsky calling the peace talks with Putin, worthless.
Redneck diplomacy.
I love how daddy sat there and let JD cook and then came in to finish it off.
That was crazy !  I watched this in parts . Everyone has parts of the meeting . The meeting was almost an hour 58 minutes .
What a goddamn embarrassment. I‚Äôm sobbing. How could we vote for two people that act like this?? Jesus. Here comes ww3
Suit? Haha! What a sheer stupidity! Trump and his guy there make no sense at all.
Right very hypocritical of him seeing as he‚Äôs the biggest dictator ever
Who is this other guy next to Trump?Is he important or what all I see he is causing drama. Bad policitics but ok if US wants someone with iq as temperature outside than they have a right guy hahahahüòÇ
The Vice President is a fascist bastard. He came to Germany after the Munich Security Conference and met with the fascist AfD party. What does this mean? It means you are a dirty fascist. Damn you.
JD said this the litigation the public media shouldn&#39;t cover. This exactly what we needed to see
americans start wars, and than speak about peac, russians start wars then speak about peac, it is not weir that you where allies in 2 world wars, and is not weird that you act like you are enemys, in case of Ukraine you preaty show that you never want to win this war on side of Ukraine. you just want to start war, and give them the money, and after you give them the money for defending own country, blackmail them for returning 1000x more then you gave them. If i where Zelensky, i would take the chair from office and keep it like suvenire, that no one from Ukraine ever sit on that chair in Oval office again.
Everything will be calm, it&#39;s normal to face such reaction from both parties. I am optimistic, there will be calmness and the peace deal will be signed in Jesus name. As Christians all over the world, let us continue to pray for Ukraine, Russia and Donald Trump administration to humbly restore peace peace between the two nations.There are many smart guys benefiting from this war at the expense of lives and properties but God want us to live in peace and as God&#39;s Children we will stand in the position of God and proclaim peace in Ukraine and Russia and it will stand.May God grant President Donald Trump the patience and wisdom to resolve this crises in his victorious name amen.

I was out at a gaming get together in Kyiv last night when the Zelensky-Trump meeting was being livecast. It was all anyone was talking about obviously and each new shoe dropping was like a blow that rippled through the crowd. But then someone asked me, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt trump realize who he‚Äôs dealing with? We‚Äôre Ukrainian. We‚Äôve done two revolutions. When you push against us we band together.‚Äù Another said ‚Äúif there was an election tomorrow Zelensky would get 95%,‚Äù and so on‚Ä¶ then people started seeing the posts of solidarity from European leaders and someone shouted ‚ÄúFrance is with us!‚Äù and the crowd cheered. ‚ÄúSpain is with us!‚Äù And the crowd cheered again. So don‚Äôt lose hope, folks. If Ukraine can stand head high through this war and this betrayal, so can you.
I hope the USA&#39;s specialists will accurately read Zelinski&#39;s body language!  Crossed fingers and arms, cargo trousers to a formal presidential meeting do not say opened peaceful person who is ready to bring peace to his people. ;Rules of war.; Are there rules to follow in a war? Isn&#39;t there enough place and resources for everyone on this planet? Why should the ego and vanity of a few men should be prioritised?
I don&#39;t understand how anyone can watch this and say Zelenskyy was in the wrong. He was polite, respectful, thankful, and tried to explain the situation with Putin breaking ceasefire agreements over and over to them repeatedly. Sure, Zelenskyy made a few confused looking faces when Trump would say something blatantly untrue, but who wouldn&#39;t at least do that in the situation. He was met with pure disrespect and mobster style bullying from Trump and Vance. This is the absolute low point (so far) that I&#39;ve ever seen from a US President. I&#39;m ashamed and embarrassed for our country and I want Ukraine and the world to know that there are MANY good Americans that want nothing short of our full backing and support for the people of Ukraine and all of our allies around the world. Please don&#39;t let this poor example of American leadership be a reflection of its people. Zelenskyy was one of the only honorable people in that room, a shining example of how a good leader and a good man should be. Thank you for suffering these fools with such dignity.
Zelensky doesn‚Äôt need Trump‚Äôs help to give Putin four regions, downsize the army, and abandon NATO aspirations. If he wanted to surrender to Putin, he would have gone to Moscow, not Washington.

Yeah it is when a ton of money given to ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù went in his pocket.
i never watch things like this, but i felt i needed to see the full discussion to see why it escalated, so this is the first time ive realized that trump is SO stuck in constantly reminding people of things that happened (or at least want he wants you to think happened). the fact that this meeting was about the war in ukraine and putting an end to it and yet so many times he has to pause and talk about ;biden failed; ;this wouldnt have happened if i were president; ;i won the election by a huge popular vote; just shows that he needs to constantly tell people that he is the best there ever was, even when thats not the point of the discusssion AT ALL.

Threatening others to sign an agreement when they are in trouble is considered robbery.
This was tough to watch

Vance TRIGGERED the conflict in the meeting. He should just have KEPT quiet like Rubio.

<b>The Vice president is a really bad person</b>
I would listen to zylensky he has inside info hes been dealing with them first hand. Not speculation like some who are delusional about how easy this will all be, the decisions made in the upcoming months &amp; years will shape all of humanity. Seems hes all in &amp; only for sole reason of being looked at as one of the greatest presidents like ;George Washington;. Please be wise with the choices you decide on our fate lies in your hands
So we the USA üá∫üá∏ invested billions of dollars to help Ukraine üá∫üá¶ then now he don‚Äôt want to repay by signing the deal ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èso ungrateful..thank you is not enough
Trump: we&#39;re going to make a peace dealZelensky: No I want more war
President Zelenskyy was ambushed big time. You noticed trump standing up for Putin a cruel lying dictator and he said he doesn‚Äôt believe in putting people down when Zelensky was explaining the cruelty of him and his people. But he had no trouble putting Biden and Obama down consistently. Trump will take the Ukraines assets and let Putin in to take over. Yemen all over again.
Zelensky  is way more diplomatic than i would b
America has always followed the approach that when defeat seems imminent or the opponent appears too powerful, they bow down to the strong and target the weak. In 1945, when America&#39;s courage faltered, they cowardly resorted to using the atomic bomb. The same is being done with Ukraine; they got scared of Putin.
I‚Äôm 20 minutes into this - so far - Zelensky and his journos have asked for aid, arms, money 8 times!!!! He was never going to sign an agreement he wanted support. He wants money, arms and aid. He wants to continue the war.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
I think Trump was right throughout! And I think Vance did a great job on pointing out that Zelensky was not thankful enough. The war should never have started from the beginning‚Ä¶ requesting for more tension and military aid would just end up in much bigger war‚Ä¶ possibly world war III‚Ä¶ diplomacy is what human being needs. Last but not least I think Trump was overall nice‚Ä¶ Hopefully, people could appreciate peace ‚úåüèº
Trump hate Zelensky, Trump dont respect Zelensky. He said,that i thought that You are taller, that to ask come to play golf,but you are so small...It was discasting how Trump played good ,but acted as Cremlin worker
President Zelensky make so many negotiation mistakes i couldn‚Äôt even count on my fingers
Trump and Putin are guy lovers. they need take a room, and fuck each other. Europans need cut off American influence, and suport Ukraina and Russia, mediate peace, and kick american ass hard and depp with footh. They speak about 350 bilion doloars, american idiots we in europe cut off cheap gas and oil from Russia because of you, how many dolars we lose for only that, do you even have brain how many dolars euros in europe we lose for your policy wich we have only financial loses, and Ukrainians loses in half milion lives, and ruined ocupied country, how much that cost in dolars ? And now morons dare to speak, about disrespect, go in Israel Jewish lovers, and take all money wich you gave to Netaniyahu and Israeli, and military you suport more Israel than Ukraine, and you never ever ask price of cost for Israel and goverment of Jewish, because this pupets in America they dont serve enyone, they serve to money. and money is Jewish courency, because everyone in world know how much influence they have behinde courtain with money. All this wars they start, to take others resurces and play act like a victim, behinde this pupets like Trump they play hide and seak, and they think we are all dumb to dont see what is hapening, and Zelensky is on point, in your ;sunny american coust; sun is always shining but in others sun is not shining because of your so called ;suport; and ;allied; shit. my country is in NATO and EU, but if it is on me, i would canceld bouth membership, when i see who runs EU and NATO administration, when americans have such influence on bouth i know we are all doomed to be pupets in their show, and to act like less important because they act like they are only important in all that political ishues and military policy. So smart people, dont come in guest where they know they will be mistreetad, only mistake Zelensky did is to come to this idiot Trump, and give him publicly important role in resolving war in own country, if i am Zelensky, i would cut off Trump after this, and all war policy efforts based on european soil, after all Ukraina is in europe, she is not 51 american star, so she need resolve problems in Europe, continent where she politicly and geograficly belongs. If Americans want act like bullys, and speak about money, than is time to shut that dore for good, and make peac with Putin if he want peac, and with europe rebuild country, without american influence and deals wich will ruined generations of Ukrainians for greedy american administration, and Jewish influence wich run this pupet show behinde the scene, because obvius like a day where money is influence there most be some Jew ;victim; who geting rich behinde blood of inocent Ukrainians and Russians, this war is obvius american war like all wars after 2ww, i speak about biger wars, not small like was in my country, but in each of that wars they have influenced on bad way and try to blame victim for defending own country.

Thank the president Trump? Republican has blocked military aids for Ukraine last winter. It has cost for Ukraine thousands of civilian deaths and lost more teritories.

@@uuuummm9 ;Have you said thank you once in this meeting?; That was JDV&#39;s question. Yes in fact Zelensky said thank you at least 3 times not even 8 minutes into the video. Why are you qualifying it and moving goalposts? And even more so why would you not let your ally speak in a meeting?

It&#39;s a jab at the fact that Zelensky is not allowing his people to hold elections and therefore acting as a dictator to Ukraine.
Wow Trump is disgusting
Amazing content as always!
Zelensky cares more about minerals than about the lives of his people.
Gosh suit question was out of the world. To beg for arms he needs to look like West. Trumps soo smart he turned someone else&#39;s war to his opportunity. Nations should never go into war and take US help. Look at Pakistan. Never take US money. Jd vance is like a child. He is not trump. Trumps a business man. Jd vance isn&#39;t built like him
Zelensky is doing everything in his power not to punch the sh+t out of Trump.
Honestly, the president of Ukraine shouldn‚Äôt have said what he said about our country that we don‚Äôt feel it now, but we will fill it later. I honestly don‚Äôt know what he meant, but I don‚Äôt blame him for thinking the way he does because like he mentioned deals were made before And they were broken so of course he‚Äôs worried for his people because he promised his people before that they would be protected, not once not twice but three times for me he‚Äôs doing everything he can for his people. I see it in him that he really cares and he cares for the children in his country. I honestly like the last question that one of the reporters ask Donald Trump but what if Russia breaks the deal Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt really answer that because in reality it could definitely break, a deal are just words and actions speak louder than words and we all know the stupid question that was asked Why is he not wearing a suit? I understand he is in a very important place in our country with our president, but do you think that the last thing he would care about is looking good like the rest of the people in the room no of course not he‚Äôs there fight, and to protect his people. And yes he has said thank you to Donald Trump many times but at the same time all I know is that he is hoping that it is true that his people will be protected and that the deal stays that way, and the war for them would stop. honestly I appreciate that Donald Trump is at least trying to make a deal with Russia, but Putin is a very mean and dangerous man. I honestly feel that the one who started the war should end the war with peace ‚òÆÔ∏è

Yeah but he needs to let Trump help him get peace without putting our boots on the ground. Zelensky won&#39;t be happy until he has our soldiers in the war with him. That will never happen!!!
People criticizing president Trump should kindly remember one fact that any further nudging to Russia into a corner and they will have to use nukes. We dont have such courage to witness use of atomic bombs. If Ukraine has to compromise more, they should not for just themselves but world peace

The orange pompous ass meets dictators with more respect and diplomacy, which show clearly that the current President of the Free World sitting next to him in this video is no dictator. Trump just tore down the post war international order like a bull in a china shop, signalling to the whole world, that they can no longer rely on anything under the current administration. This damage, however, will survive any future elections.
There‚Äôs alot that happened here. Should be watched more than once. To be honest Ukraine has been dealing with Russia for years and he knows just like our past leaders knew Russia can not be trusted as they will break the agreements. This isn‚Äôt a real-estate deal this war! trumps arrogance is where he is totally blind to the fact that Putin is not his friend. What‚Äôs one of the best ways to win a war? Make the advisories believe your an ally to defeat the others and then you take them down when they least expect it. He‚Äôs a fool

Just walk away.  It&#39;s not America&#39;s war.  Russians have been killed with US weapons.  If that happened to me then I&#39;m considering it as being attacked by Ukraine and the USA. Trump can&#39;t run again and that&#39;s great cause I can finally vote Republican. I just couldn&#39;t vote for him but I&#39;m glad he won after seeing this first month. How long has this war been going on?  It&#39;s around 3 years now? Each country has lost roughly 1 million citizens each.  The US has send Ukraine between 200-350bn dollars. My point is that things haven&#39;t gotten any better in 3 years.  Why not take a different approach?  You don&#39;t like the approach?  Screw it,  let&#39;s stay on the successful path we&#39;ve been on with this war then.
Is this the way Americans treat their OWN war heros and military staff? With ingratitude and contempt?  Probably yes, also Elon is firing all ;the unnecessary; personnel.

Trump and Zelenskyy‚Äôs last meeting ended in a heated clash, with Trump accusing Zelenskyy of risking ;World War III; and canceling a minerals deal. The fallout has strained U.S.-Ukraine relations, while European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine.

I think folks may not understand that the guarantee that Ukraine would want is that if Putin breaks the cease-fire that the Trump&#39;s administration puts in place, which is likely, what would the Trump administration do? Trump is either so narcissistic that he thinks that he is soooo good at ;deals; that he can&#39;t imagine that Putin would ever betray him, or this has always been the ploy from the beginning that through Trump&#39;s help Putin will own Ukraine and split the profit of the raw earth minerals.Ukraine should NOT make this bargain.

THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN AND EUROPE IS WITH ZELENSKYY‚ù§AND THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE‚ù§
I think they planned this. They thought they could bully him in to letting them to steal the Ukraine&#39;s resources. They&#39;re using Ukrainian youth as fire wood in the hopes if weakening Russia. They just showed the true color of imperial plale and not white America. Russia and Ukraine should work it out between themselves and Ukraine should join BRICS. The way they disrespected him and took turns to insult him was humiliating. Not ony for the president but also for the Entire Nation of Ukraine.

Damn, Zelensky in a room full of arrogant idiots.

Show us the far deal -‚Äú we will be inside? What take over a part of Ukraine like you want to take over Gaza? What‚Äôs with the set up questions
Ikr. The dude trying to lay the law down. Also this sort of thing is for closed door meeting. I think they tried to embarrass Trump into an agreement and Vance didn‚Äôt appreciate it being displayed in public
This was very informative, appreciate it.
So in other words trump is saying that zelensky has to give his land away for peace, this is a rip deal
What video were you watching?
An agreement to go to war should not be given freely.
I find it interesting that CNN asked the question about guaranteed security‚Ä¶
What wars offer you guarantees? If you break ceasefire you&#39;re giving your enemy am excuse to get other countries involved...
This was super helpful, thanks!
Juvenile Zelenskeyy.  Why did he in the first place want to be a part of NATO by which all this shit happened. üòÆ
Usa has no rare earth agreement. Zelensky walked away and tgere was no lunch and will not sign after trumps insulting behaviou which has offended all of europe and other allies like Australia, uk and all of the eu.  He needs to discuss that with putin too. Trump does not seem to be aware russia invaded ukraine without any discussion with any nation. Now adolf trump wants to negotiate with putin to give up ukraine soveignty after ukraine gave up its nukes as part of a us agreementTrump sounded like he wants to take and profit from the rare earths. Not buy it. Sell it to germany and france.
Yea but what Zelensky Is saying is that is NOT going to work. Putin has broken 25 signatures. Zelensky wants the US to go head first into a war with Russia. But trump doesn‚Äôt want to do that because then that would be WW3, because China will get involved so basically trump is telling him he‚Äôs on his own, either sign the deal or you lose the war.
@@speedstyle. 100% this. Also on the US&#39;s previous assurances for a deal with Russia (1994), Ukraine got rid of its nukes. Now Russia is looking at them as free real estate. It&#39;s 100% reasonable to say a ceasefire is not lasting peace.
He is defending his countty, this is not a deal. Why dont trump goes to putin and say he has to stop?
Putin started the war i he shall finish it not Zelenski.

yeah some how i thiink u may be right...
Nah trump winking at the reporter who asked about President Zelensky abt his suits is crazyy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ trump defend him like he sent em there lmao
Zelenskyy was just pointing out that if Putin gets Ukraine, the next one will be a NATO country. This is the same reason Europe is giving them so much, it&#39;s not altruism or some loan they can recover, it&#39;s just more effective to hold the line to begin with.
Then zelinski lacks common sense. How do you make demands against an opponent who clearly defeated you lol. Imagine Hitler making huge demands as Berlin was about to fall. Man you jokers live in cloud cuku land
I think people are misunderstanding why Trump and Vance are a little upset. They need Zelensky to put aside the anger, to be able to cooperate to get a peace deal. Zelensky is obviously deservedly incredibly angry, Putin did a lot of terrible things, but putting aside anger is the only way to get a deal to save lives. I like Zelensky he&#39;s a proper human, but now he unfortunately has to play politics.
Thank you for the great content!
This meeting was interesting but I&#39;m not sure trump or vance is real peace makers america have sent alot of money to Ukraine but they could  exchange minerals with us trump also seems to be on puttin side or actually terrified of him America should continue supporting Ukraine and we need to add them Nato so we all can have more strength
Vance is a toddler with a beard.
Normies in comments defending zelensky are DELUSOONAL and dont know anything
It&#39;s not too much to ask but he has to read between the lines, this is politics. By entering a binding agreement for mineral rights with the United States, it comes with IMPLIED security. This allows Putin to save face and each side can spin it as a win. Trump was right when he said it&#39;s going to be hard to get a deal done unless attitudes change. He was referring to how Zelensky explicitly said there is no compromise with Putin. If there is no compromise with Putin, WTF are we doing here? Why are we negotiating a ceasefire? Let them fight it out to the last man.
Looks like he was high on coke
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Stupid questions from journalists!! Why don&#39;t you wear and suit?? Do you own a suit???
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Indian&#39;s attendanceüòÖ-
Disgusting trump and j.d.
Zelenskyy a big coke headüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Your English listening skills are apparently appalling. Zelinski has LOST the war, yet wants the us to continue throwing good money after bad and for what gain exactly?
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Great job, this video was very useful!
So, trump switched gears to protect JD Vance from his comments. I believe the whole world heard Zelensky clearly said thank you in this meeting multiple times, so for this to be a point of contention is really baffling in a position of peacemaker. Hopefully we all learn from this and bring a peaceful end to the war.
Vance clearly lacks emotional intelligence, and doesn&#39;t have the wisdom of Trump in negotiation and deal making. He destroyed a conversation that was going well. People say Trump is volatile &amp; egotistical. I disagree, but JD takes those descriptions above and beyond. There is a clear difference between confidence and arrogance. JD is full of himself and frankly full of s.hit going by how he handled this. Absolute bully behavior. Imagine how conversations go with his wife and kids.
Brilliant move Zelenskyy... Debate JD Vance on live TV. Good luck, fuckface.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Trump is very professional and he is doing his job better than anyone else in that room.
The suit thing was definitely not ok. Why would a person question a president&#39;s dress. Tbh it was very rude.
Vance messed up
OMG! Zelensky is a president?! Jeez!!! Such a clown. Please act with some  integrity if you want to be treated with respect. DIPLOMACY GONE FOR A TOSS!!! The guy doesn&#39;t care about people dying at all. Just wants aid coming in.. such a corrupt fellow
U must be in China. Sounds like their rhetoric. Justice is nothing but fighting for ur own interests
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
So what do trump want.. him to get down and kiss his feet.. I can‚Äôt stand this fool
Amazing content as always!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Great job, this video was very useful!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
This Meeting was a shame... Vance didn&#39;t understand what ist going on. He ist talking about a deal and democracy. But a clear question from Zelensky he can not answer and He is feeling to be pushed in a corner. Vance had no answer on facts of the ukrainian experience with russia contracts Vance has turned the emotions in this room into an ice block. Vance, shame on you.
Thank you for the great content!
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=187">3:07 Thanks so much, Thank you for the meeting and invitation<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=455">7:35 Thank you very muchSo what exactly is JDV talking about at <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2655">44:15? Zelensky&#39;s tone was also very polite and requesting until the sudden turn by JDV and Trump. There&#39;s also 4 minute long compilations of Zelensky thanking the US and its leaders. Why does this feel like misinformation and gaslighting?
Europe isn&#39;t being purely altruistic, they know that Putin won&#39;t stop at Ukraine. The US also gave aid for this reason, the next one will be a NATO country and cost them a lot more. Agree on everything else
vance and trump pissed with Zelensky cuz he didn‚Äôt suck trump‚Äôs dick on the spot. This is so embarrassing just a bunch of babies in suits. Wish this country was run by women and not fragile little boys
I 100 percent agree. Maybe vance is a throw away fall guy. Immediately after vance said how dare you question me and disrespect my master trump says no I want this to be public and vance goes ;sorry master;, ;you&#39;re right my lord;. He&#39;s Trumps permenantly bent down Igor. This is coming from a 3 time Trump voter. I hate that he had to defend vance for his stupidity. Basically they all have to defend vance to now show any cracks in the shield.
Inhumane , disrespectful and moral less behaviour at best !! Disgusting!!Bunch of bullies .Good on Zelenskyy for resisting and respecting all for his countries peace and safety üôè
Oh so clearly they had no intention of signing a deal for a secure Ukraine. This was reality TV meant to provoke Zelenskyy live. And now the world sees where US allegiance lies.
vivek dumb too
Why can&#39;t Canada have such leadership?!
Does trump think this is a reality show or something. Like OMG. It‚Äôs pretty clear that he‚Äôs sided with Putin and that‚Äôs scary for this country. Kamala you warned us.
I wonder if Trump would be as ‚Äòaligned‚Äô with Russias dictator, if USA were the ones being BOMBED??? üò≥
I agree with trump pn this one not everything but this one he was the right thing

This was very informative, appreciate it.
They could have worked something out it Vance did not blow it and Trump come to his defence.
tell that to putin who started this war
No feelings in business.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
it seemed like a trap
If anyone listen to Zelensky - all he wanted to bring across that ceasefire is not enough to finish the war. Ukraine has been doing it since 2014, Zelensky himself tried so many times to please Putin and was accused by his own government of making mistakes doing so. I think we can learn something from previous mistakes or should we make them again and again. Zelensky said that ceasefire agreements were broken 25 times. üòÆwe need lasting peace. Trump is very sure of his deal with Putin, and wants to stay impartial. How can be impartial, when all he wants ‚Äúdig, dig, dig ‚Ä¶ lots money to be made‚Äù
Thank you for the great content!
They already signed two ceasefires in Minsk, effectively giving territory to Putin, and he invaded again when he felt like more. What&#39;s the point in a ceasefire without any consequences backing it up? Zelenskyy wants peace, not peace deals.
Why would Russia even think to break the deal with Americans mining the resources? They do that, it&#39;s bad for them. Why would that dude even bring up the past with Obama? Trump isn&#39;t Obama. So stupid.
That cocaine has got Zalynski&#39;s head. What a joke

This video was amazing, learned a lot.
You explained this so well, thank you!
If Zelenskyy just accepted the agreement and makes a deal. Everything will be all good. US and NATO will always back up the Ukraine. Zelenskyy just being tough  and hardss for a small country. That‚Äôs why trump talked smack about him. We all know how trump is. That why a lot of ppl hate trump because how he is. Trump is a smart business man. He wanted every country economic runs smoothly.
Great job, this video was very useful!
Decorum exists for a reason: we‚Äôre not simply robots crunching numbers and facts. By sidestepping normal protocol‚Äîaddressing another speaker directly instead of the media, and disregarding the established dress code‚ÄîPresident Zelensky shows how even minor breaches of decorum can have serious, real-world repercussions, potentially costing lives. It‚Äôs just how it is.
Why the fuck even is vice president allowed to speak during meeting? Its pre planned ambush and Putin does similar stuff in russia so its not hard to see where they got the idea.
We Standing with zelenskey
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Casually discarding the commitment to a more democratic world will inevitably lead to America&#39;s decline. Even if the Democratic Party returns to power and tries to make amends, it will be to no avail.
The media often rushes to characterize Trump&#39;s stance on Putin as supportive, overlooking the nuance in his approach. Trump emphasizes that effective diplomacy necessitates balanced negotiations; openly favoring one side exclusively risks alienating the other, making peaceful resolution unattainable. J.D. underscored that a significant portion of Ukraine has suffered immense destruction, using this point to illustrate the urgency and importance of diplomatic strategies the current administration is pursuing‚Äîstrategies that differ from the previous administration‚Äôs hardline stance, which left limited diplomatic avenues open with Putin.Zelensky took personal offense at this characterization, perceiving it as diminishing Ukraine&#39;s resilience. Unfortunately, he responded by directly confronting the Vice President and publicly questioning the administration&#39;s effectiveness in preventing territorial occupation during its first term. Zelensky&#39;s confrontational approach displayed limited composure and strategic foresight, undermining an important diplomatic opportunity. The President, recognizing Zelensky&#39;s lack of appreciation for the careful diplomatic positioning at play, sees this reaction as detrimental to progressing towards a meaningful ceasefire and lasting peace.
Vance is fool
Trump; we want to get this over with ;Zelenksy states into space there goes the holiday home in Mauritius....
I think this whole mess is also because of Zelensky English üòÖ, ;What are you talking about JD ,have you ever been to ukraine ;
Does anyone really believe that if the US had financial interests in an agreement with another country that the US wouldn&#39;t protect those intrests? Take Taiwan for example. Does the US turn a blind eye to them? No because the US has a financial intrest in Taiwan. That alone would be security enough. Ukraine would have been immediately under US protection by agreeing to a ceasefire and accepting the deal. The war would have been over with a signature of a pen and there would have been an influx of money into that country to rebuild it and heal it from the sale of the rare earth minerals sold to the US. It could have been a great partnership.
Mr. Zelensky repeat the same assumptions....that Russia will continue and that Ukraine soldiers are fighting for the whole Europe. Russia has no intention to attack Poland or other countries which are NATO allies.
We all pay taxes as Americans! Every single American adult should recieve the 5k relief.
The comments show just how much America has gone to shit let‚Äôs be honest it‚Äôs been shit since the white mfs came to the country. But it‚Äôs also very showing to just how evil EVIL humanity really is . Coming from a white person i wouldn‚Äôt even b mad if every other race turned on us we ALL and I mean ALL deserve that shii .
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Both presidents are same. One was film actor and people make him president, other one was property business tycoon, people make him president. So now listen them and enjoy them. Both presidents gave beautiful slogans to their Nation and told them shortcuts toward prosperity and dignity. Unfortunately both Nations will suffer.Boris Johnson and Imran of Pakistan was also from this Shortcut Tribe, UK and and Pakistan are facing the after shocks of their prime minister.Next decades the US and and Ukraine will face the after shocks of their presidents.When people will elect the celebrities and tycoons as a leader, the consequences are physically in front of you.Innocent people will suffer.Dialogue between two presidents looks like a gossip in a Sunday Market.
You explained this so well, thank you!
Show us the far deal -‚Äú we will be inside? What take over a part of Ukraine like you want to take over Gaza?
This was not a meeting. This seemed more like the US pushing its agenda through the media , and Trump showing power. You can clearly see the discomfort of Zelensky , who was denied almost every opportunity to answer. In the 50mins , i think he was only allowed once to speak more than 2 secs. On the other hand , Trump&#39;s right that they are the wildcard Ukraine cannot allow to lose. But it&#39;s not diplomacy to enforce your will like he does.
@@Supremax67 its been how long? Biden ran us into the ground. If you voted for him you voted for mega corporations because they were pulling the strings.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
America switching up on theor allies when the president changes means they are an unreliable partner. Time to ditch USA.
The moment JD VANCE opened his mouth everything went south. The United States looks like the worst country on the planet for how they treated this man who was there and has far more experience than Trump or Vance with PUTIN. The proof is information leaked out to intelligence communities showing Putin and the main players in Russia actually smiling and laughing because they finally seen Trump and his moron vice president fighting with Zelensky on Putin&#39;s behalf. Shame on the Administration of the United States for their actions.
Stupid you trump and your administration... He thanked many times even in this meeting.
Lol trump thinks the whole world revolves around him .. i did this.. i saved that ..me me me all me me me ..says ANYTHING for attention.. grandfathered in clown
Someone please give zelensky spare briefs
That&#39;s not what he said. He said ;we can&#39;t just <b>speak</b> about ceasefire, it will not work; because they already signed the Minsk agreements, Putin broke them and invaded. He wants actual peace, not just peace deals
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=500">8:20 ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have much raw earth. and the raw earth we do have is protected by the environmentalist, but it can be undone.‚Äù Im sorry what?!?

TRUMP &amp; VANCE never stood a chance against ZELENSKY!They thought that it was the usual, and simply dealing with some ordinary head of state.But, that is VLADIMIR ZELENSKY who has been leading UKRAINIANS ferociously against a RUSSIAN military machine that outguns &amp; outnumbers them 10 to 1.A brave &amp; bold leader, tested &amp; was under fire, who dragged RUSSIA into a quagmire, and depleted their RUSSIAN military supplies &amp; equipment, causing PUTIN to seek assistance from NORTH KOREA to send in NK troops to serve as human sacrifices in its never-ending war against UKRAINE.On the other hand, DONALD &amp; JD both have no actual experience in real combat, in leading a grinding fierce war, and totally no experience in fighting a more powerful adversary. It just so happened that they were there and elected as the PRES &amp; VP of a superpower on the decline &amp; failing fast,Remember when ZELENSKY asked JD during that discussion if he was there in person, in the actual place where everything is happening, JD simply said that he only ;saw it and watched;; assuming he knows it all completely. Remember when ZELENSKY stated while TRUMP was continuously scolding and defending his VP that ;he was summoned there to talk; and the 2 bullies won&#39;t allow him to stating he talked a lot already.ZELENSKY, in fact, has a pointIt seemed only that he was the villain on this since he was outmaneuvered and overpowered during that heated argument, also, not to a homecourt advantage. He was invited there of course and JD keeps on saying DISRESPECT?! He simply cannot fathomed that ZELENSKY has a point and is cornered so since there are media around, they were keeping and holding that reputation. And what&#39;s with the ;not thanking; issue?!So when ZELENSKY showed his game face and how a true, grizzled leader reacts when pushed against the wall, these 2 stupid &amp; bully idiots whom AMERICA designated as their leaders were simply reduced to like some mere children not being able to get their way in their own front yard.So their response??THEY WENT INTO A HISSY BlTCH FIT LIKE A BUNCH OF SPOILED BRATS. TRUMP &amp; VANCE just fvcked around &amp; sadly found out!‚Ä¢ I supported TRUMP and his admin ever since his candidacy and after what happened yesterday, I am thinking otherwise! If they can do that to another PRESIDENT, imagine what he can do to ordinary people - powerless and fragile. You do not belittle and scold a leader of another country in front of the entire world just because he did not agree with your terms.ZELENSKY simply wanted assurances &amp; security, not the money that they were claiming, but those 2 bullies are having some intentions now slightly exuding naturally!‚Ä¢ watch that discussion again after reading this if you can &amp; observeüòêü§îüòí
Zelensky said in 2019 putin broke the ceasefire and they went off on the poor dude not fair...... Trump was the president in 2019 so he did break the deal MR TRUMP....They got all but hurt for him calling them out because they didn&#39;t do shit to putin for breaking the contract.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
President Zelensky - As an American, please don‚Äôt come back. USA is broke and our national debt is at an unsustainable all time high. USA cannot afford to continue to fund this war. Europe needs to step up and pay the lion share along with providing the security guarantees. USA should not provide any security guarantees and be dragged into this never ending war that Ukraine will never win. The American public does not support using US taxpayer funds to pay for this war, and Trump was elected President on the basis that support for never ending foreign wars would stop immediately.

You&#39;re a chihuahua fighting a war against a Great Dane, you&#39;re already dead. Realize that and bend the knee.
Zelinski wants more billions so it can be funnelled and laundered by the deep state.
America has NEVER looked so stupid. how in the fat eyed potato did these guys ever get elected.  fraud?   when is the CIA going to  de-elected these 2 Bozos?
Trump wants a peaceful diplomatic deal. Zelensky wants to pull in Europe and USA into World War III because he refuses to admit defeat

So much of exaggeration, faking up the facts, threats from Zelensky about Russia. These talks excludes Russia and they should not, because there are many things that Zelensky misrepresents to attract attention and pull his own cards.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Mr. President Zelenskyy is unmatured and seems emotional
Zelenski looks like a fish out of water
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!

no body respects you trump
Sorry Vice president
Shame on USA, shame on Trump and his team
Russia is more free then Ukraine. F Z
Unless its good cop bad cop which it doesnt seem i think Jd vance steps out of line and is eager to show his ass.Trump had to back his vice presiden.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
I cannot BELIEVE this weasel is president AGAIN. Lord help us

<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2520">42:00 it&#39;s tuning bad for Zelensky? TOUGH!
The complexity of the entire situation is too much for a quick explanation. It appears Zelenzky was enjoying support from the previous presency along with UK support, and now he isn&#39;t getting it. All Trump cares about is what he can get out of it, which on paper sounds good because people value his ;business; tactics but that in itself can be dangerous depending on what his end game entails and the damage he will cause just to make a buck, based on. The way he speaks about Putin makes it seem as he learns towars supporting him more than holding a neutral position which then begs the question of what he&#39;s really up to.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Can&#39;t believe trump choose this dumb Vance instead of Vivek üòÖ
This Ukraine president doesn&#39;t want to stop this war, he is really trying to influence Teump to take up arms and aim at Russia. Trump puts it clear that he wants this war finished.Zelenky thinks Russia don&#39;t have allies to support him.
I really think this was all just theatre to showcase the dilemmas facing all parties concerned. It has to be this way to show strength.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Y a du bois de palettes dans la chemin√©e ????
Canada committed boots on the ground with the United Nations id thats what it takes.
i‚Äôve never seen him in a suit lol
If Vance didn‚Äôt take part in the discussions there would&#39;ve have been any argument.

Stop Burmese civil wars as well, Mr President.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
I beg the forgiveness of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people for the abhorrent behavior and foolishness of Trump and Vance. Putin is insane and must be stopped.Ukraine has the support of all sane and morally responsible US citizens, though we have insofar failed to remove these frauds and oligarchs from positions of power. Our country is at war with itself, and any promises coming from the current administration are unreliable at best.
That was quick üò≥
We can tell Trump felt bad about this ‚Äúsuit question‚Äù so he gave a positive comment about his outfit afterwards and I love him for that.
beggars can&#39;t be choosers
Ok so a few things i took from this meeting...#1 - Whichever news media outlet is responsible for the moron who asked the dumb question about Zelensky not wearing a suit, do everyone a favor and fire that guy. Why insult someone in the middle of peace talks?...Ridiculous..#2 - Zelenskyy...what outcome did you expect to come from saying in the middle of this interview that ;a ceasfire is not possible; ??? What is the point of having peace talks when you say things like this...Irresponsible..#3 - JD Vance...dude...why did you have to get all emotional and go off on such a rediculous rant about ;when have you said thank you; blah blah...while i understand that Zelenskyy was the one that asked you loaded question, you should have taken a few seconds before replying. You could have avoided escalation, and worst of all, ryling up Trump to engage in such a ridiculous argument.#4 - We NEED a new meeting to resume these peace talks! JD Vance needs to stay out of it this time. And Zelenskyy...either you come ready to talk real piece OR except the fact that you will be losing U.S. support moving forward.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
It&#39;s sickening to watch the ignorance and arrogance of Trump and Vance. Trump won&#39;t speak bad on Putin but will disrespect his predecessors. Putin only invidad during the Biden administration because he knew Biden was overwhelmed with trying to resuscitate this country from Trump failed first term. Now this fool is about to get us alienated. No wonder countries are turning on us. This was disgusting
Trump and JD Vance are two cowards that embarrass the United States to the Whole World. These two guys are shameless and a disgrace.
Amazing content as always!
Extremely disappointing in JD Vance and for the reporter who asked about Pres Zelensky‚Äôs attire. Zelensky just travelled 10 hrs, was jet legged, exhausted with a 3 yr war, trying to express his concerns in a language not his primary. His concerns re security are legitimate, especially given Putin‚Äôs history with his country. Now that the Zelensky‚Äôs and Trumps thoughts have been publicly aired, they should return to the table and do a deal. If the US have a vested interest in their country, being the minerals and related resources, there would be inherent security in their presence I would think.
Sign the deal, or we will stop the aid!!! üòÖüòÇ Absolutely üíØ!!
I saw no results, big talks no results.
Why upload in only 720p?
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Biden screwed the USA, with the Ukraine and illegal immigrates. What do you really think about Biden/Hunter ?
Trump lies when he says Biden had a cease fire agreement with Putin. Putin signed an agreement with Ukraine, France, Germany in 2019 while TRUMP was president. Putin broke that. Biden met with Putin once in 2021 and no cease fire agreement was signed. The invasion began February 2022.
The white house disrespected HIM!  How sick!  Americans voted for the Donald!
Trump put this puppet in his place..war mongering europe.needs to do the same thing !    Isreal needs to get out of Palestine.. and needs to respect international Law. Stop killing kids ! Disgraceful
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
This was super helpful, thanks!
This administration is a Joke
Trump parrot?  No imagination?
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
@<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=716">11:56 Zelensky is making comments on how EU gave a lot. Trump jokingly says much less... don&#39;t argue with me; wooow! Signs of the future breakdown of the conversation
This was very informative, appreciate it.
So you are saying Russia should conquer countries unopposed?
Great job, this video was very useful!
Zelenskyy wants this war to end permanently, you have to understand his point of view. Trump can solve this problem now, but he‚Äôs not gonna be the president forever. putin can do anything when he wants to, he can be the president of russia till he dies. So this should be well calculated.
Just stop the Ukraine war !Why are young men dying for a past President. That Biden gave 200 billion
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Typical eastern euroLet me make better deal
Perfectly said!

TrumPutin, be careful with JD Vance. With a Vicepresident like him, you don&#39;t need enemies.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
I learnt a lot from this conversation ,wish Mr Trump can really stop this God damn war .....
It was going good until that dumb question about the suit -_-
Trump and JD take a long walk off a short peer. That would be helpful
Not another dime for Zelensky.  Not another American weapon.  No more wars.  ENOUGH OF THE WARS!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
What is he saying here? Weapons we are gonna use in many countries???üòÆ
Donald Trump adore Putin.  No matter what he pretends he serves Putin!
The $350b number Trump keeps using is a lie. But he knows Fox and OAN will not call him out on the lie so he can keep lying to his base.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2434">40:34 that‚Äôs when the argument got heated up, do you really think his tone towards a sitting vice president at the end ‚Äòwhat diplomacy are you talking about MR JD Vance ‚Äò is satisfactory? He‚Äôs more towards biden and democrats who gave away funds backed with nothing..
Maybe he should do a ceasefire instead of kidnapping his own citizens on the streets who don&#39;t want to fight, chucking them in blacked out vans, and chucked on the front line... yeah i bet if u left wing dorks saw those videos youd quickly change your stance. If he doesn&#39;t ceasefire his country will fall millions more will die.
JD and Trump reacting the way they did towards Zelinsky makes me think that they&#39;re afraid of Putin.
Damn I was actually thinking for a bit that Trump was acting very cordial and restrained up until the end where they just bullied zellenskyy, a man dealing with problems they could never comprehend. What a bunch of bullies.
The last 5-10 min the tension is through the roof üòÇ
Trump gives us transparency in his negotiations. He&#39;s working for the American people.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
putting US workers in Ukraine will end the war, as long as we are taking (stealing) their natural resources.  hahaha trump is sneaky.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
This was super helpful, thanks!
From the word go, Zelensky wanted guarantees for Ukraine! He needs his country to be calm and at peace. Is that too much to ask?
Bro this would have not happend if the vp didnt esclate it ü§å
<a =":/shorts/ZmpnT2XnYqo">:youtube.com/shorts/ZmpnT2XnYqo?si=KEnLbhgZ0s0N4kyC
Um, Trump?  Zelensky was predicting something, not dictating.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
How did negotiations be held without any Ukranians being involvedThis meeting deteriorated rapidly with drumpft &amp; vance yelling, while Zelensky maintained his composure.Money is the only thing on the puke&#39;s  mind.He did not win by a landslide, nor is this a mandate from the majority of Americans.Nothing he has done is what was voted for by any of the totality of the voters on the whole; just listen to the Townhall Meetings, on borh sides.üíØüíôüíôüíô
Wow. Vance jumped straight on Zelensky, completely unprovoked, and yelled at him and then proceeded to continually attack and insult him. Wtf, that was downright nuts, it didn&#39;t even make any sense. Then Trump just ran with it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
First and foremost. I do not support a news outlet that doesn&#39;t allow speech in it&#39;s comment section.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
If this meeting had only been between Trump and Zelensky without anyone else it may not have happened this way. Vance was a disgrace .
Trump is 100% lying there!  Europe gave a lot more money than the United States to Ukraine, and they didn&#39;t even care if they got it back or not.  They just truly wanted to help Ukraine.  <a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=616">10:16  Trump is an opportunistic parasite kicking Ukraine in the teeth when they&#39;re down.  Also weather President Zelinskyy wears a suit or not is not the subject here, and the person that brought it up is a childish idiot for even mentioning it.  Trump didn&#39;t even listen to what President Zelinskyy said when he said that Russia has violated the ceasefire many times before.  They need to bring the 20,000 children back home to their parents, and the pastors as well.  This has nothing to do with a card game, this is about people&#39;s lives, and people dying, and people being kidnapped, and even beaten.  Trump says; ;I empowered you to be a tough guy.;  President Zelinskyy is already a tough guy without anyone&#39;s help.  It&#39;s president Trump that&#39;s disrespecting President Zelinskyy and treating him like garbage.  Trump and Vance also needs to stop grandstanding like overcooked pigs.  This is Putin&#39;s midlife crisis war.  Putin needs to go to war to feel good about himself.  Before the Russian Ukraine war I used to really like Putin alot, but after Russia started this war I now only see Putin as a crazed lunatic.  If Putin succeeds in conquering Ukraine he will not stop there.  He will go into the Baltic and Poland.  He needs to be stopped!  Putin has broke his own signature 25 times!  Is President Trump really so retarded that he thinks a ceasefire on a piece of paper is going to stop Putin.  A piece of paper is not going to stop bullets, bombs, and missiles from killing their people.  They need security!
Ok Svetlana
Zelensky wants the world to pay for his war.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
trump is just a sick old individual I can&#39;t call human
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Apologising is irrelevant‚Ä¶  I know people want to say whatever cause they just hate Pres. Trump but P.Trump is correct and doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat it‚Ä¶ Ukraine WILL not win with Russia and only has a chance if USA steps in to help but by doing this then China and N. Korea will step in and then we have WWIII where it is now USA, Russia, China, Europe and Middle Eastern and we all know nuclear weapons will be used and boom‚Ä¶. Earth is gone!!

How dare zelelensky disrespect the white house
Russia was initially a state in the former Soviet Union, which was a communist country. The Soviet Union kept invading it&#39;s neighbors, which is why NATO was founded in 1949.Months before the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Ukraine, which fought for it&#39;s freedom, became a Constitutional Republic with fair elections, similar to the U.S.A..Russia is a totalitarian dictatorship, with State-run press, no free speech, where protest is not allowed, and where Putin&#39;s political opponents are imprisoned or murdered. Russia invading countries has continued.Since Ukraine was founded, Russia has invaded Moldovia, fought two wars in Chechnya, invaded Georgia, (Not Georgia, U.S.A., obviously), and Russia invaded Crimea, Ukraine in 2014. That follows a long history of Russia, or the former Soviet Union, invading countries it borders. That&#39;s why Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, all that border Russia, are NATO members today.And, the arguments some people have made to oppose helping Ukraine are the same arguments some people made when Hitler&#39;s Germany invaded Austria, and then Poland.ùòê&#39;ùë£ùò¶ ùëõùò∞ùë°ùò™ùò§ùò¶ùëë ùë°‚Ñéùò¢ùë° ùëõùò∞ùò∏ ùò¥ùò∞ùòÆùò¶ ùëùùò∞ùëôùë°ùò™ùò§ùò™ùò¢ùëõùò¥ ùò¢ùëüùò¶ ùë°ùëüùò∫ùò™ùëõùò® ùë°ùò∞ ùëùùëüùò¶ùò¥ùò¶ùëõùë° ùëÖùò∂ùò¥ùò¥ùò™ùò¢&#39;ùò¥ ùëëùò™ùò§ùò¢ùë°ùò¢ùë°ùò∞ùëüùò¥‚Ñéùò™ùëù ùò¢ùò¥ ùò∞ùò¨ùò¢ùò∫. ùòêùëüùò∞ùëõùò™ùò§ùò¢ùëôùëôùò∫, ùë°‚Ñéùò¶ùò¥ùò¶ ùò¢ùëüùò¶ ùë°‚Ñéùò¶ ùò¥ùò¢ùòÆùò¶ ùëùùò∞ùëôùò™ùë°ùò™ùò§ùò™ùò¢ùëõùò¥ ùò§ùò∞ùëõùò¥ùë°ùò¢ùëõùë°ùëôùò∫ ùëüùò¢ùëõùë°ùò™ùëõùò® ùò¢ùëèùò∞ùò∂ùë° ;ùò¥ùò∞ùò§ùò™ùò¢ùëôùò™ùò¥ùòÆ; ùò¢ùëõùëë ;ùò§ùò∞ùòÆùòÆùò∂ùëõùò™ùò¥ùòÆ.;ùêÉùê®ùêßùêöùê•ùêù ùêìùê´ùêÆùê¶ùê© ùêöùêßùêù ùêâ.ùêÉ. ùêïùêöùêßùêúùêû ùê°ùêöùêØùêû ùêúùêöùê•ùê•ùêûùêù ùêüùê®ùê´ ùê©ùêûùêöùêúùêû.

That&#39;s both the moral choice, and also nobody should trust the United States in the future if we don&#39;t keep our word. We got Ukraine to disarm, and abandoning them now would be very wrong.And, regardless of our policy. Donald Trump claiming President Zelensky was to blame for Russia invading Ukraine was a false and insane claim. And, days later, after pressure from some Republicans, when he seemed to backtrack on that claim, he then said that Zelensky and Biden ;accepted; the invasion, which is another crazy claim.
ZELENZKY CAN PLAY A PIANO WITH HIS DICK TRUMPS MUSHROOM NOT GONNA HAPPEN
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
The US told Ukraine to disarm nuclear weapons, wanted minerals, now ask Ukraine wearing suit.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=2392">39:52 This is when JD spoiled the party and sabotaged the signing. On purpose? Clown show either way
Why doesn&#39;t he wear a suit? On that note, show some class. You&#39;re asking the leader of the Free World for 250 million dollars in foreign aid. Your third world hellhole country is NOT owed American blood. Nor is it owed American dollars. Nor is it i infact owed anything by anyone.
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Trump and Vance have already made their mind to look down on Zelensky before the meeting, no matter what he says. I elected them and I know they can improve.
Trump keeps winning

Great video! Really enjoyed it.
body language says everything
Was it a press conference for Trump  or was it supposed to be a negotiation?  Trump spent the whole time telling us how much better he is than Biden, smh. What a waste of everyone&#39;s time.
Trump continues criticizing Biden a lot and didn‚Äôt realize he is not in the election campaign anymore.  He does not need to do that‚Ä¶
Bought and paid for by Russia.
I think that went well context is üîë
Such a stupid question - what has to do how he is dressed
So DID THEY HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER?????
Putin is not trust worthy deep down he&#39;s evil and will turn on us One day
Great job, this video was very useful!
vp vance is like scared little bit sch, hiding behind her big bf throwing insults and letting her bf take the hits.  trump should remove this guy for his own good.
I suggest that zielinski should get in the ring with Putin and Duke it out there in the ring.. the winner gets control of the losers country
So, Russia invaded Ukraine and massacre the population and President Trump favor the deal to the Russians üòÆ
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Raw Earth? Trump, it&#39;s rare earth.
So he has a point. What&#39;s to stop Putin from breaking the ceasefire since he doesnt seem to care much about agreements he makes. Trump seems so sure his friendship will make him keep his word this time that he doesn&#39;t wven consider it. Him and this guy next to him are freakin jokes. He bashes Biden so much, but he doesn&#39;t have room to talk. We are in for a rough four years if the first month is any indication
Trump thinks he‚Äôs still on the apprentice üò°
‚ÄúRaw Earth‚Äù? üòÖ
It‚Äôs hilarious and sad how these ;diplomats; get hysterical, when the discussion begins not just ;peace and negotiations are needed;, but how to achieve this peace and how arguments can have weight so that these negotiations can begin at all, their rose-colored glasses gets shattered, that simply saying ;let&#39;s make peace; will not work, and they begin to talk about ;respect;, because they have nothing to answer and they have nothing more to say
When you gain an eye twitch and drop IQ points after visiting the 2025 US Oval Office. Option A. Make a deal with no set guarantees that Russia wont continue attacks. or B. Don‚Äôt make a deal, and Russia continues attacks. ü§îü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëè

Vance shut your mouth.  You are a traitor and disgrace to America.
It seems Zelenskyy is under influence of some drugs where he will not take  a valid reason for cease fire ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The way they dealt with him should be more diplomatic instead of letting swords out ‚Ä¶
It illustrates where the expression ‚Äúson of a b-itch‚Äù comes from. We all learned about JD‚Äôs mother from Hillbilly Elegy, and we clearly see how a dude raised by such a low life ~loose~ woman ends up being true ‚Äúson of a b-itch‚Äù. That‚Äôs where the expression comes from. He is not the first not the last. Such loose messed up women shouldn‚Äôt be mothers, because the final ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of their parenting is as we all see, true son of a b-itch.
I can never comprehend the fact that Americans voted for the piece of shit who boasts his chest in front of a president whose country is being attacked. What the hell did really happen here ?
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Zelensky appears to be intoxicated.Does anyone else get that impression?
About 2 minutes in, Trump says ‚Äúit was supposed to be over with very quickly‚Äù.üòÆ
Ironic thumbnail
A good time to remember that during his first term, Trump met with Putin in private and told the press that what they spoke about was ;none of [our] business;
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1960">32:40  Trump is asked if he would be willing to visit Ukraine.  He declines to answer. Yet in the last few days he expressed a desire to go to Moscow. RUSSIAN STOOGE!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Trump is acting hyper as hell
This was very informative, appreciate it.
JD vance look like a villain straight out of Hollywood movie
Zelenskyy is a child
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Great job, this video was very useful!
Trump and Vance are not wanting peace. They are a dangerous joke.
with all that phony scam trump talks about, why should zelensky trust anything trump says?  he is afraid US is going to mine all their resources until it runs dry and then bail, leaving them back to square one with russia.  most likely when trump leaves office after 4 years, and next one happens to be a lib lunatic, they are going to pull out of ukraine and russia will go right back in.  politians are all a bunch of liars.  what a sad world we live in.  where is righteousness?  does it even exist?
The ONLY thing Trump wants to do is GET THE PRECIOUS MINERALS FROM UKRAINE.Without guaranteeing that the U.S. would provide assistance when Russia breaks the cease fire agreement. Trump wants EXACTLY WHAT PUTIN WANTS... The precious metals that are in Ukraine....and he ALWAYS SOUNDS SO STUPID when he puts downs every president before him.
Very poor attitude of Zelensky
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
<a =":/7pxbGjvcdyY&amp;t=1815">30:15 Trump claims that he stopped wars before. Fails to name any. Another lie.
Oh how cute. Two well fed bullies ganged up against one guy whose small defenseless country is a victim of russia, and they ‚Äúshowed him‚Äù. Same heroism as robbing some  blind old grandma at a sidewalk.
People are really Twisted, At one point they want to stop the war and the only way of doing that is a deal which Trump can help provide, and at another side they want Ukraine to win, like wth? No one wins in a war, I would rather lose and save life of people than Go in a war which i definitely can&#39;t win. What do you think Zelensky is doing, he&#39;s legit sacrificing his people in a war that he can&#39;t win and it&#39;s a fact. What&#39;s the point of all this? To have piece of land? Like fr?
Zelensky‚Äôs only mistake at this meeting was that he fussed.  This is due to lack of experience.   Otherwise he won.  Because he had a conscience on his side.  And on the other side there were completely different passions.
This interview shows that Trump words means nothing. He claims that Zelensky is playing with war, when it‚Äôs clear that the only person, that don‚Äôt consider this as a serious meeting is Trump. He doesn‚Äôt care about a peace at all, just wanted to show that he ‚Äútried‚Äù to do something by wasting time of the people
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
God curse America. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. There is no god, we brought this curse on ourselves so, fuck us all... Seriously, I&#39;ve never been more disgusted or ashamed to be an American in my life...

This is a major screw up. You NEVER stage a possible signing of documents for the cameras unless it is a done deal. It makes me suspect that IF they had made it to the signing in the East Room, the documents would be nothing more than non binding ;goals;A few years ago, Trump staged a dramatic signing of papers with Kim Jong Un and the documents were just full of non binding goals then too.
Zelenskky put his foot in his mouth. He should have his ambassador do the talking next time , if there is a next time.
We love you, President Trump thank you for our country first‚ù§üá∫üá∏

OMFG this is so FUCKING infuriating, the entire thing!!! Holy SHIT!!!
What a joke. The United States is the laughing stock of the world. They should pull themselves together and look past their ego and pride.
Disgusting what a disgrace to what America used to be.
Trump is an unbelievable POS.  Trump, the ;Bone spur; draft-dodging, coward, has the balls to lecture the bravest leader of the 21st century about war. This isn&#39;t a peace talk. Ths is Trump attempting to rape Ukraine of it&#39;s mineral reserves for Putin. Zelensy should have punched the sh+t out of trump
That last 20 minutes was a masterpiece straight from The Jerry Springer vintage catalog. They sound like a group of high school boys
Thank you for the great content!
This joke of a president is defending Putin. Like he&#39;s a victim. Worthless.
Actors play for you peoples
Zekensky definitely has some valid points as well as Trump!!!!! üôè hope this gets resolved ASAP!!!!!  Very sad situation!!!!!!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
RUSSIA IS LOSING THE WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, AND PUTIN IS DESPERATE FOR A PEACE AGREEMENT.
Trump will be known as a ;Piss Maker; and not a Peace Maker.
All he wanted to was to dress nice, have lunch, sign the documents and that‚Äôs it. Save Ukrainians.
They tell us how many soldiers have died for Russia and for Ukraine‚Ä¶ We are taking their word, thats the problem. Nothing is verifiable. Can‚Äôt keep taking their word as bond. They are continuing the fake news
Hilarious üòÇ Trump is the best!
Vance shouldn&#39;t have even been there. And that reporter asking dumb questions about suits either. Disgusting.
TRUMP IS GOING TO MAKE THE USA FALL EVEN MORE THAN IT IS...AND BY MAKING THE USA GREAT, (WHICH HE HAS NEVER DONE), HE WILL MAKE THE USA MORE ALONE THAN EVER...I THOUGHT THAT TRUMP WAS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT, BUT SO FAR A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...
It would be great to see Putin&#39;s first impression of this meeting
