00:00:06.399 well thank you very much it's an honor
00:00:08.000 to have President zalinski of Ukraine
00:00:11.679 and we've been working very hard very
00:00:13.759 close so we've actually known each other
00:00:15.360 for a long time we've been dealing with
00:00:17.439 each other for a long time and very
00:00:19.439 well we had little negotiation spat but
00:00:22.960 that worked out great I think for for
00:00:24.720 both countries I think for the world
00:00:26.840 actually Beyond both countries and we
00:00:29.840 have have something that is a very fair
00:00:32.960 deal and we look forward to getting in
00:00:36.079 and digging digging digging and working
00:00:38.200 and getting some of the rare earth but
00:00:41.239 it means we're going to be inside and
00:00:42.800 it's a it's a big commitment from the
00:00:45.000 United States and we appreciate working
00:00:47.879 with you very much and uh we will
00:00:50.399 continue to do that we have had some
00:00:53.239 very good discussions with Russia I
00:00:55.320 spoke with President Putin and we're
00:00:57.920 going to try and bring this to a close
00:00:59.760 as something that you want and that he
00:01:01.320 wants we have to negotiate a deal but
00:01:04.080 we've started the confines of a deal and
00:01:06.280 I think something can happen uh the big
00:01:10.040 thing is the uh number of soldiers
00:01:13.799 mostly at this point but soldiers being
00:01:15.680 killed you're losing thousands of
00:01:17.280 soldiers on both sides we're losing a
00:01:19.040 lot of soldiers and we want to see it
00:01:21.400 stop and we want to see the money get
00:01:24.159 put to different kinds of use like
00:01:25.799 rebuilding the rebuilding and we're
00:01:28.600 going to be working very hard
00:01:30.680 but we've had a lot of very good
00:01:32.159 conversations I will say until we came
00:01:34.600 along the Biden Administration didn't
00:01:36.880 speak to Russia whatsoever they didn't
00:01:38.880 speak to anybody they just allowed this
00:01:40.920 to
00:01:41.680 continue and uh I will say that uh I'll
00:01:45.000 say in front of you you've heard me say
00:01:47.119 it a thousand times if I were president
00:01:49.320 of this war would have never happened we
00:01:51.000 would have had a deal negotiated for you
00:01:52.799 without having to go through what you've
00:01:55.159 gone through but you uh your soldiers
00:01:58.280 have been unbelievably Brave we've given
00:02:00.439 them great equipment but they somebody
00:02:02.079 has to use the equipment they've been
00:02:03.640 unbelievably Brave and we give them
00:02:06.640 great credit this was supposed to be
00:02:08.598 over very quickly and uh here we are
00:02:11.920 three years later so I give tremendous
00:02:15.400 credit to your generals and your
00:02:17.319 soldiers and yourself in the sense that
00:02:20.160 uh it's been very hard fighting very
00:02:23.560 tough fighting they great Fighters and
00:02:26.599 uh you have to be very proud of them
00:02:28.120 from that standpoint but now we want get
00:02:30.120 it over with it's enough right we want
00:02:32.800 to get it over with so uh it's an honor
00:02:35.760 to have you here thank you very much for
00:02:37.239 coming we're going to sign uh the
00:02:39.319 agreement at the conference in the East
00:02:42.720 room in a little while right after lunch
00:02:46.480 and we'll be having lunch together we're
00:02:48.239 also discussing some other things and we
00:02:51.400 appreciate everybody being here it's a
00:02:53.920 somewhat of an exciting moment but the
00:02:55.680 really exciting moment is where we get a
00:02:58.280 when they stop the shooting and we end
00:02:59.680 up up with the deal and I think we're
00:03:01.319 fairly close to getting that and uh an
00:03:03.959 honor to have you and please like to say
00:03:06.680 something no thank you so much Mr
00:03:08.720 President thank you for invitation and
00:03:12.159 um really I hope that this um document
00:03:15.879 first document will be first step to
00:03:18.040 real security guarantees for Ukraine our
00:03:20.239 people our children I really count on it
00:03:23.640 and of course we count that America will
00:03:26.239 not stop support really for us is very
00:03:28.599 important to support and to continue it
00:03:32.120 I want to discuss it with details
00:03:34.000 further during our conversation and of
00:03:36.959 course the infrastructure or security
00:03:38.720 guarantees because for today I
00:03:41.280 understand what Europe is ready to do
00:03:43.480 and of course I want to discuss with you
00:03:45.360 what United States will be ready to do
00:03:48.239 and uh I really count on your strong
00:03:50.560 position to stop Putin and uh and you
00:03:53.519 said that enough with the War I think
00:03:55.760 that is very important been to say these
00:03:58.519 words to Puttin at the very beginning at
00:04:00.879 the very beginning of War because he is
00:04:02.560 a killer and terrorist but I hope that
00:04:05.040 together we can stop him but for us is
00:04:07.519 very important to you know to save our
00:04:10.720 country our values our freedom and
00:04:14.239 democracy and of course uh no
00:04:17.279 compromises with a killer about our
00:04:19.519 territories but it will be later and of
00:04:22.120 course I what I wanted you know we spoke
00:04:24.440 about it by phone with you about the
00:04:26.759 Dron production we have very good Dron
00:04:28.880 production I think the best one in the
00:04:30.639 world for today because of the war yes
00:04:33.880 and uh of course we need very much uh
00:04:36.880 the air defense you have the best air
00:04:39.160 defense in the world and really you
00:04:40.919 helped us under attacks of Russians and
00:04:43.759 I want to speak how we can exchange the
00:04:46.320 licenses we're open to share the
00:04:48.800 licenses of all our drones with you of
00:04:51.080 course with the United States and we
00:04:52.520 need licenses for quick production of
00:04:54.960 air defense even after the war we need
00:04:57.320 our nation to be calm that we are
00:05:00.440 secured so that's why we need this air
00:05:03.000 shield and of course about this uh I
00:05:06.520 want to speak about the conion I think
00:05:09.039 that France and UK already spoke to you

00:07:47.960 questions
00:07:51.680 please thank you Mr President um with
00:07:54.080 the uh how much money is the US going to
00:07:55.599 put into the fund that that is being
00:07:57.159 created today and how does this provide
00:07:59.240 long long term security for Ukraine well
00:08:01.599 we don't know exactly how much because
00:08:03.560 we're going to be putting some money in
00:08:04.919 a fund uh that we're going to get from
00:08:07.199 the raw Earth that we're going to be
00:08:09.560 taking and sharing in terms of Revenue
00:08:12.240 so it's going to be a lot of money will
00:08:13.560 be made from the sale and from the use
00:08:16.159 of raw Earth and as you know our country
00:08:18.199 doesn't have much raw Earth we have a
00:08:20.080 lot of oil and gas but we don't have a
00:08:23.240 lot of the raw Earth and what we do have
00:08:26.479 is protected by the environmentalists
00:08:28.800 but that could be unprotected but still
00:08:30.639 it's not very much uh they have F among
00:08:34.799 the best in the world in terms of R so
00:08:37.640 we're going to be using that taking it
00:08:40.559 using it for all of the things we do
00:08:42.399 including Ai and including weapons and
00:08:45.399 the military and it's uh really going to
00:08:48.120 very much satisfy our needs so was
00:08:49.880 something that just worked out uh really
00:08:52.240 well we have a lot of oil and we have a
00:08:54.000 lot of gas we have a lot but we don't
00:08:55.480 have Ro Earth so uh this uh this has
00:08:59.120 just about every component of the raw
00:09:01.240 Earth that we need for computers for all
00:09:03.560 of the things we do this puts us in
00:09:05.920 great shape and the long-term security
00:09:08.519 fore I think they're going to have great
00:09:10.959 look I think once we make the agreement
00:09:12.519 that's going to be 95% of it it's
00:09:14.640 they're not going to go back to fighting
00:09:16.880 uh I've spoken with President Putin and
00:09:19.920 uh I think I mean I feel very strong
00:09:22.160 I've known him for a long time and I
00:09:24.320 feel very strongly that uh they're very
00:09:26.519 serious about it and we'll make a deal
00:09:29.480 when the deal is made I don't think we
00:09:31.560 talk about security everyone's talking
00:09:33.160 about the other day all they talked
00:09:34.480 about was security I said let me make
00:09:36.160 the deal first I have to make the deal
00:09:38.200 first I don't worry about security right
00:09:39.839 now I got have to we have to have a deal
00:09:41.880 because right now last week 2,000
00:09:44.240 soldiers died on both sides 2,000 and
00:09:47.640 they're losing a th000 2,000 3,000 a
00:09:51.120 week so as we sit here and we talk
00:09:53.120 people are getting shot and dying on the
00:09:55.800 battlefield and you know they're not
00:09:57.839 American soldiers but they're Russian
00:10:00.200 soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers
00:10:02.360 and we want to be able to stop it and we
00:10:05.120 want to be able also to spend money on
00:10:07.120 other things we don't want to this is a
00:10:09.040 tremendous amount of money and what the
00:10:11.440 Biden Administration did was terrible
00:10:13.920 they were giving money but he had no
00:10:15.360 security on the money Europe as you know
00:10:17.680 gave much less money but they had
00:10:19.320 security it was in the form of a loan
00:10:21.560 they get their money back and we didn't
00:10:23.079 and now at least we're protected because
00:10:26.240 the American taxpayer has to be
00:10:27.880 protected too but uh this is an
00:10:31.360 incredible agreement for Ukraine because
00:10:35.560 we have a big investment in their
00:10:37.160 country now and and what what they have
00:10:40.480 very few people have and we're able to
00:10:43.560 uh really go forward with very very
00:10:45.760 Hightech things and many other things
00:10:47.639 including Weaponry Weaponry that we're
00:10:49.880 going to use in many locations but that
00:10:52.560 we need for our country this allows this
00:10:55.519 allows us to do this
00:10:59.440 sorry I'm
00:11:00.839 sorry yes go ahead please I can just yes
00:11:06.079 in the document there is one of the very
00:11:08.000 important points uh if we speak about
00:11:10.120 business and investment we never had LG
00:11:13.880 terminals in Ukraine this document will
00:11:16.680 open I mean the next documents but
00:11:18.560 anyway the here we see in the framework
00:11:20.920 we we see we see really good will for
00:11:23.200 this energy terminals for us is very
00:11:25.279 important and I think for security of
00:11:28.240 European continent we have the biggest
00:11:30.519 storage gas storage we have the biggest
00:11:33.560 in Europe yes it's yeah and we can use
00:11:36.760 it you get for LNG use it for L and we
00:11:40.320 will do it and really we we can help
00:11:43.240 Europe because Europe really helped
00:11:45.000 president Trump said that they made uh
00:11:48.040 less support but they have our friends
00:11:50.959 and they our very supportive uh Partners
00:11:54.000 they really gave a lot Mr BR really they
00:11:58.639 did they gave a lot but they gave much
00:12:00.839 less no much less
00:12:06.040 no
00:12:14.519 okay Mr President Trump you have
00:12:17.040 repeatedly called the deal with Ukraine
00:12:19.480 has as a historical one and as a
00:12:22.760 president of the United States you make
00:12:25.240 historical decision in other issues
00:12:27.600 which affect America and the world so uh
00:12:31.880 what place in the world history do you
00:12:34.160 want to take and do you associate your
00:12:37.959 yourself with any famous historical
00:12:43.279 figures yeah I'd say George Washington
00:12:45.760 Abraham Lincoln I would say I'm far
00:12:49.320 superior to George Washington and
00:12:51.040 Abraham Lincoln now you know I'm only
00:12:53.480 kidding right because when I say that
00:12:55.480 the fake news is going to go wild
00:12:57.079 they're going to say he considers
00:12:58.440 himself to be better than Washington but
00:13:00.680 you never know you never know uh I don't
00:13:03.839 compare myself to anybody I just have
00:13:05.639 I'm here to do a job I we've had a great
00:13:08.680 35 days or whatever it might be a month
00:13:11.040 a little more than a month uh We've
00:13:13.839 accomplished tremendous amounts not only
00:13:16.320 this this would be a very great
00:13:17.880 achievement if we could get this the war
00:13:19.600 stopped and get them back to
00:13:21.920 normalization I think that's going to
00:13:23.720 happen we've had very good talks on both
00:13:26.279 sides as you know but uh I think we've
00:13:29.199 done a very good job just generally if
00:13:30.880 you look at all of the things we've done
00:13:32.480 in 30 days they're saying there's never
00:13:34.600 been a opening for a president the first
00:13:37.600 month uh there's never been a first
00:13:39.800 month like uh like we've had and this is
00:13:42.680 one of the very important things this to
00:13:44.279 me is one of the most important things
00:13:46.399 because we have tremendous death taking
00:13:49.279 place as we speak and I don't want to
00:13:51.800 have that you know think of the parents
00:13:53.360 think of the whether they're in Russia
00:13:55.199 or Ukraine think of the parents of all
00:13:57.440 these people being killed needlessly
00:14:00.040 they came to our should have never
00:14:02.279 started this would if I were president
00:14:05.399 this would have never
00:14:10.480 started will you continue sending
00:14:13.199 military aid to Ukraine after you uh the
00:14:17.079 US signs this agreement with Ukraine
00:14:19.920 question to president zy do you feel
00:14:22.440 like the US is on your side that the
00:14:25.240 Pres that President Trump is on your
00:14:28.440 side at this uh at this
00:14:32.399 moment what do you think he wants to
00:14:34.759 know do you think that sort of a stupid
00:14:37.720 question I guess I guess we wouldn't be
00:14:40.000 here if I
00:14:42.120 wasn't I think that I think that the
00:14:44.560 United States on our side from the very
00:14:46.959 beginning of
00:14:48.320 occupation and uh I think that President
00:14:50.880 Trump on our side and and of course and
00:14:54.560 not I'm sure that United States
00:14:57.040 President will not stop support this is
00:14:59.839 crucial for us it's important for us yes
00:15:02.920 and Putin president speaks about the
00:15:05.240 people and the soldiers which are dying
00:15:07.360 but they came to our territory they came
00:15:09.120 to our land they began this war and they
00:15:11.600 have to stop and uh I think all this is
00:15:15.560 the question with really the most
00:15:17.759 important question can president Trump I
00:15:20.600 hope yes with some other allies to stop
00:15:24.519 Putin withdraw these enemies our ene
00:15:27.720 withdraw these troops from from our land
00:15:30.120 and I think that you asked about the
00:15:32.160 history about the I think that if
00:15:34.639 president or when he will stop Putin if
00:15:38.040 president Trump will bring peace to our
00:15:40.000 country I think he will be on this wall
00:15:43.720 and I we've had very very good uh
00:15:50.399 talks UK president zinski just said that
00:15:54.120 there' be no compromises with um
00:15:57.040 Vladimir Putin um I just wanted to ask
00:16:00.319 both of you firstly um are there
00:16:02.519 compromises that you think that
00:16:03.880 president zinski is going to have to
00:16:05.319 make and president zalinski is there
00:16:07.000 anything that you might be thinking you
00:16:08.720 may be able to offer or ring to the
00:16:10.079 table for example elections thank you I
00:16:12.720 think you're going to have to always
00:16:14.040 make compromises you can't do any deals
00:16:16.360 without compromises so certainly he's
00:16:18.199 going to have to make some compromises
00:16:19.880 but hopefully they won't be as big as
00:16:22.680 some people think you're going to have
00:16:24.000 to make that's all that's all we can do
00:16:25.880 I'm here as a as an arbitrator as a
00:16:28.240 mediator to to a certain extent between
00:16:30.680 two parties that have uh been very
00:16:33.040 hostile to put it mildly they've been
00:16:34.639 very hostile there has been a vicious
00:16:36.240 War this been a vicious War you know
00:16:39.120 it's a very level Battlefield and uh
00:16:41.240 those bullets go out and as I've said
00:16:43.360 many times we talking about it with Pete
00:16:45.959 uh many times the only thing stopping
00:16:48.000 those bullets is a human body and in the
00:16:51.000 case we're talking about generally young
00:16:52.920 human bodies are stopping a lot of
00:16:54.600 bullets it's dead level that's what why
00:16:57.240 it's great Farmland it's great land it's
00:16:59.399 great Farmland but there's very little
00:17:01.560 protection against the bullets that are
00:17:03.600 being and other things that are being
00:17:05.319 shot so all I can do is see if I can get
00:17:09.480 everybody at the table and get an
00:17:11.799 agreement and I think we're going to end
00:17:13.039 up with an agreement otherwise I
00:17:14.359 wouldn't probably be even here
00:17:20.039 today Mr President I've got two
00:17:22.079 questions for you you think ultimately
00:17:23.760 your legacy will be The Peacemaker and
00:17:26.359 not the president that led this cont ing
00:17:29.240 into another war and ended Foreign Wars
00:17:32.000 and then I've got question I hope it
00:17:33.799 will I mean I hope I'm going to
00:17:35.760 be uh remembered as a
00:17:38.320 peacemaker uh this is this would be a
00:17:40.720 great thing if we could do this I'm
00:17:42.160 doing this to save lives more than
00:17:44.160 anything else second is to save a lot of
00:17:46.320 money but I considered that to be far
00:17:48.160 less important so I hope I'm going to
00:17:50.480 thank you Brian for that question it was
00:17:51.760 a nice question uh I hope I'll be known
00:17:54.640 and recognized as a peacemaker this this
00:17:56.919 would be a great thing to solve this is
00:17:58.480 a very dangerous situation you know this
00:18:01.720 could lead to a third world war this is
00:18:04.400 this was headed in the wrong direction
00:18:07.120 if this election were lost if we didn't
00:18:10.000 win this election and by we we won it by
00:18:12.039 a lot that was a mandate we won every
00:18:14.080 swing state we won the popular vote by
00:18:16.720 millions and millions of votes we won
00:18:18.799 everything uh the districts you look at
00:18:21.360 the areas of of red take a look at a map
00:18:24.320 this was a big mandate and uh this was
00:18:27.280 one of the things I said we're going to
00:18:29.360 get this thing settled if we didn't win
00:18:31.880 I think this would have this could have
00:18:33.559 very well ended up in a third world war
00:18:35.840 and that would not that would not have
00:18:38.120 been a good situation what was your
00:18:39.600 second question my second question for
00:18:41.080 president zalinski now do you ever why
00:18:43.480 don't you wear a suit you're the highest
00:18:46.280 why don't you wear a suit you're the
00:18:47.440 highest level in this country's office
00:18:49.919 and you refuse to wear a suit just want
00:18:52.039 to see if you do own a suit yeah you
00:18:54.320 have problems I I a lot of Americans
00:18:56.440 have problems with you not respecting
00:18:58.039 the office uh I will wear costume after
00:19:02.200 this war will finish okay yes maybe one
00:19:06.320 maybe something maybe something like
00:19:07.679 yours yes maybe some something better I
00:19:10.720 I don't know we will see maybe something
00:19:13.360 cheaper than yeah thank you thank
00:19:18.600 you thank you president Trump you said
00:19:20.799 yesterday are you going to send more
00:19:22.919 arms to Ukraine in case there's no peace
00:19:26.440 yeah we're going to have arms to Ukraine
00:19:28.440 yeah here hopefully I won't have to send
00:19:30.480 very much because hopefully we're going
00:19:31.799 to have it finished we're looking
00:19:33.600 forward to finishing this quickly uh
00:19:36.679 we're not looking forward to sending a
00:19:38.360 lot of arms we're looking forward to
00:19:39.760 getting the war finished so we can uh do
00:19:42.520 other things but uh we very much
00:19:45.320 appreciate the agreement because we
00:19:46.799 needed what they had and we're treating
00:19:50.039 you know our country is now treated
00:19:51.640 fairly Biden didn't do that b didn't he
00:19:54.000 didn't know what the hell he was doing
00:19:55.200 this should have never happened this
00:19:56.320 should have never started but uh
00:19:59.320 you know sure the answer is yes but
00:20:01.159 hopefully we won't have to send much
00:20:03.679 because I'm looking forward to get it
00:20:05.799 done getting it done quickly very
00:20:08.880 quickly does that provide security
00:20:10.679 guarantees Mr President uh I don't want
00:20:12.919 to talk about security yet because I
00:20:14.760 want to get the deal done you know you
00:20:16.200 fall into the same trap like everybody
00:20:18.080 else a million times you said it over
00:20:19.720 and over I want to get the deal done
00:20:22.000 security is so easy that's about 2% of
00:20:24.799 the problem uh I'm not worried about
00:20:26.840 security I'm worried about getting the
00:20:28.280 deal done uh the security is the easy
00:20:30.799 part security is very nice everybody
00:20:32.919 stops shooting and now will Europe put
00:20:35.360 people there I know France is going to I
00:20:37.720 know the UK is going to I know other
00:20:40.280 countries are going to and they happen
00:20:41.640 to be right next door we haven't
00:20:43.559 committed but we could conceivably you
00:20:45.240 know we have Security in a different
00:20:47.200 form we'll have workers there uh digging
00:20:50.000 digging digging taking the raw Earth so
00:20:53.240 that we can create a lot of great
00:20:55.000 product in this country uh so in that
00:20:58.080 sense you have something but we haven't
00:20:59.880 determined that yet I will say uh in
00:21:02.320 speaking to France and in speaking to
00:21:04.760 and they were here as you know last week
00:21:06.600 and just the other day uh they have
00:21:09.919 committed to a lot of security I don't
00:21:13.039 think you're going to need much security
00:21:14.400 I think once this deal gets done it's
00:21:16.080 over Russia is not going to want to go
00:21:18.240 back and nobody's going to want to go
00:21:20.039 back when this when this deal ends I
00:21:22.400 really believe this deal is is going to
00:21:24.440 be over uh question yeah please go ahead
00:21:28.039 go ahead Mr President thank you uh you
00:21:30.440 had mcon and Kier starmer at the White
00:21:32.559 House this past week both of whom
00:21:34.279 praised your courage and conviction to
00:21:36.120 lead the pathway towards peace yes part
00:21:38.360 of that involved though re-engaging
00:21:40.679 Russia in diplomatic relations something
00:21:42.640 that previous leaders lacked the
00:21:44.039 conviction to do so what gave you the
00:21:45.960 moral courage and conviction to step
00:21:47.559 forward and Lead that well I love this
00:21:49.640 guy who are you with what American new
00:21:52.279 sir well that's that why I like him one
00:21:54.360 American new does a great job that's
00:21:56.159 very I like the question I think it's a
00:21:58.640 very good question it is it's a pathway
00:22:00.799 to peace it's a pathway to getting
00:22:03.679 something solved and I feel that as the
00:22:06.600 head of this country I have an
00:22:07.679 obligation to do that plus you know
00:22:09.960 we're very much involved we got involved
00:22:13.279 uh it's too bad we got involved because
00:22:15.480 there should have been no involvement
00:22:16.760 because there should have been no war
00:22:18.440 and there shouldn't have been October
00:22:19.840 7th that would have never happened as
00:22:22.039 you know Iran was broke they had no
00:22:24.200 money to give to Hezbollah they had no
00:22:26.159 money to give to Hamas they would sto
00:22:28.520 Stone Cold broke and then under Biden
00:22:31.080 they became rich as hell they went from
00:22:34.320 no money to 300 billion dollars in a
00:22:38.279 period of four years and they gave a lot
00:22:40.960 of that money away and you see what
00:22:42.520 happened and that's a real mess also
00:22:45.279 that we hope to be able to solve but uh
00:22:48.279 no I I appreciate your question very
00:22:50.000 much I just I feel I have an obligation
00:22:52.039 to try and uh do something to stop the
00:22:56.039 death I can't I can answer yes if I can
00:22:59.400 answer sorry please please and I do like
00:23:02.320 your clothing brother yeah really even
00:23:04.279 though I have to I think he's a great
00:23:06.080 guy by the way but I I don't know if you
00:23:08.159 two like each other but you know what I
00:23:10.480 think he's I think I like this guy I
00:23:12.880 don't I think he's dressed beautiful I
00:23:14.919 have more I have more serious things
00:23:17.400 than answer on such question I will
00:23:19.520 answer on more serious question if I can
00:23:22.400 yeah so please uh about security
00:23:25.000 guarantees and about just ceasefire we
00:23:27.799 can't just speak speak about thisis fire
00:23:29.600 and speak and speak it will not work
00:23:32.400 just s fire will not never work because
00:23:35.200 I'm like a president I have I have this
00:23:37.840 experience and not only me Ukraine
00:23:40.480 before before my presidency from the
00:23:42.600 2014 Putin broken 25 times 25 times he
00:23:49.919 broken his own signature 25 times he
00:23:53.320 broken his fire it he never broke to me
00:23:56.000 he never broke no no you were the
00:23:57.360 president he the president dur in 2016
00:24:01.080 you been the president Mr Mr President
00:24:03.279 you've been the president but he for he
00:24:05.320 had of course not with you but he had
00:24:07.880 during those period he had conversations
00:24:10.320 with our site and we had Normandy for
00:24:13.039 format you know the France Germany
00:24:15.159 Ukraine and Russia and he broken 25
00:24:17.559 times that's why we will
00:24:19.480 never accept just C fire it will not
00:24:22.799 work without security guarantees
00:24:24.799 security guarantees maybe president is
00:24:27.399 right about this document and other but
00:24:30.039 this document is not enough strong Army
00:24:32.200 is enough because his soldiers afraid
00:24:34.799 Putin soldiers afraid of our soldiers
00:24:37.000 when we're strong enough if we are not
00:24:39.320 strong enough if we are empty if our
00:24:41.360 storage is empty we can't defend our our
00:24:44.799 land today you know he knows that we
00:24:47.600 have me all the world knows that we have
00:24:49.240 meeting yes why he's using ballistic
00:24:52.440 Puttin today using ballistic on our
00:24:54.679 Hospital schools and Etc ballistic so he
00:24:58.000 knows that we are here and that
00:24:59.799 President Trump is really have good will
00:25:02.080 to stop to stop this war and I and you
00:25:06.000 hear now the president so why he's using
00:25:08.559 so he doesn't want to stop he doesn't
00:25:10.840 want but I hope that we will do it
00:25:12.679 really we'll do it security when we
00:25:14.960 speak about security guarantees when the
00:25:17.279 Europeans are ready for
00:25:19.039 contingence they need USA back stop if
00:25:24.039 there will will not be United States we
00:25:25.760 will not never have any conent strong
00:25:28.000 con regions from the Europeans because
00:25:30.000 they don't want to divide Airlines
00:25:32.080 connection between the United States and
00:25:34.279 the main and strongest s and Europeans
00:25:38.480 and this is crucial this is important
00:25:40.600 that what we want to speak about very
00:25:42.880 much this is very important and there
00:25:45.039 are
00:25:46.200 defense so a defense really we have big
00:25:49.880 deficit with all these systems and we
00:25:51.640 need to provide this we we need it very
00:25:54.520 much otherwise Putin will never stop and
00:25:58.360 go further and further he doesn't want
00:26:00.159 he he hate us you know it's not about me
00:26:03.120 he hate ukrainians he thinks that we are
00:26:05.679 not a nation he thinks and he shared the
00:26:08.640 SS I think maybe with your team also I
00:26:10.600 don't know but with all the Europeans in
00:26:13.279 media officially and not he always said
00:26:15.320 that we there is no such country such
00:26:18.960 Nation such language and such life like
00:26:21.919 Ukrainian no he really doesn't respect
00:26:26.000 all the ukrainians and he wants d
00:26:28.279 destroy
00:26:30.000 us we we and you are right Mr President
00:26:33.240 that's 2% this document maybe other
00:26:36.600 documents it's a very good Star very
00:26:39.360 good but it will not enough to stop this
00:26:51.080 person this is Rule of the war this is
00:26:53.840 the rule of the war during all the
00:26:55.960 centuries all the history this is the
00:26:57.640 rule of the war
00:26:58.760 who began those pay you this is the rule
00:27:03.279 Putin began this war he has to pay all
00:27:06.200 money for renovation he has to pay of
00:27:08.520 course some Russian assets what we have
00:27:12.240 in Europe about 300 billions we can use
00:27:15.279 them we can use for Innovation and buy
00:27:18.320 military support from the United States
00:27:20.200 also we can do it but it's not enough
00:27:24.320 it's circumstances do you envion the
00:27:26.799 trilateral
00:27:30.000 wait one second I want I ask this
00:27:32.200 question that you didn't like because I
00:27:33.760 wanted to know if you want to position
00:27:36.399 yourself in the middle between Russia
00:27:39.000 and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side no
00:27:41.640 I'm in the middle I want to solve this
00:27:43.320 thing I'm for up for both I want to get
00:27:45.679 it solved and uh it's wonderful to speak
00:27:49.880 badly about somebody else but I want to
00:27:53.519 get it solved if we can solve it great
00:27:55.760 if we can't solve it they're going to
00:27:57.000 have to fight it out and who knows
00:27:59.039 what's going to happen but I want to see
00:28:01.039 it get solved may I follow up one more
00:28:03.799 question about US troops in Europe uh
00:28:06.559 after Russian invasion of Ukraine uh
00:28:10.000 your predecessor sent additional troops
00:28:12.120 to Eastern Europe including Poland my
00:28:14.519 country are you committed to keeping
00:28:18.000 this troops on the Eastern flank of
00:28:21.440 NATO uh in the future I'm very committed
00:28:25.600 to Poland I think Poland is really
00:28:28.320 stepped up and done a great job for NATO
00:28:30.360 they as you know they paid more than
00:28:31.960 they had to they are one of the finest
00:28:35.399 groups of people I've ever known uh I'm
00:28:38.039 very committed to Poland what about
00:28:39.640 baltics Poland's in a tough neighborhood
00:28:41.320 you know what about Bal the baltics uh
00:28:44.080 the baltics uh they got a lot of it's a
00:28:48.240 tough neighborhood too but we're
00:28:50.240 committed we're going to be very
00:28:51.760 committed and we're committed to Nato
00:28:54.080 but NATO has to step up and the
00:28:55.679 Europeans have to step up more than they
00:28:57.559 have and I want to see them equalize
00:28:59.720 because they are in for far less than
00:29:01.640 we're in and they should be at least
00:29:03.919 equal you understand that why is the
00:29:06.720 United States we have an ocean in
00:29:08.279 between why is the United States in for
00:29:10.640 so much more money and other things as
00:29:13.799 Europe with that being said as you said
00:29:16.480 they've also been obviously very helpful
00:29:18.960 but we have put in far more than they
00:29:21.120 have and I think they should equalize Mr
00:29:25.440 President please goad about the
00:29:27.320 agreement again today what changed
00:29:28.799 between the first time that secretary
00:29:30.200 vess gave president zalinsky the
00:29:32.720 agreement and today for the signing what
00:29:34.519 we made a deal so I'm I'm I'm a business
00:29:39.159 person we made a deal that's what
00:29:41.399 changed I didn't think we were going to
00:29:43.200 make a deal and uh we ended up making
00:29:47.039 the deal so that change Mr President
00:29:48.880 what and how do you envision a
00:29:50.039 trilateral summit with president zinsky
00:29:52.279 and I don't know but well they don't
00:29:54.320 like each other I can tell you that they
00:29:57.159 do not like each other said this is not
00:29:58.559 a love match and it's unfortunate that's
00:30:01.679 why you're in this
00:30:03.440 situation the United States should not
00:30:06.120 have allowed this to happen Okay the
00:30:08.880 United States run by a man that didn't
00:30:12.519 know much I'm going to be very nice run
00:30:16.399 by an incompetent person very
00:30:19.159 incompetent person should never have
00:30:21.279 allowed this to happen I've stopped Wars
00:30:23.960 I've stopped many wars my people will
00:30:26.240 tell you I stopped Wars that nobody ever
00:30:27.679 heard of about I sto Wars before they
00:30:29.519 ever started you can look at some of uh
00:30:33.440 some of I could give you a lot of
00:30:34.840 Nations that would tell you right now
00:30:36.240 they were probably going to war I could
00:30:37.760 tell you right now there's a nation
00:30:40.039 thinking about going to war on something
00:30:42.679 that nobody in this room has ever even
00:30:44.240 heard of two smaller Nations but big
00:30:46.880 still big and I I think I've stopped it
00:30:51.120 but this should have never happened
00:30:53.679 about uh about sorry just a second uh
00:30:57.440 about any negotiations that first of all
00:31:00.440 I want I want really to tell you and I
00:31:02.679 think that everybody understand that
00:31:05.360 Ukraine more than ukrainians nobody want
00:31:07.960 to stop this war but at the future any
00:31:11.519 negotiations it's understandable that
00:31:14.720 two uh sides of the war not Russia and
00:31:18.519 the United States because this is not
00:31:20.120 the war between Russia and the United
00:31:21.799 States This Is War of Russia against
00:31:24.399 Ukraine and Ukrainian people so these
00:31:26.600 two sides will will be at the any anyway
00:31:30.000 will be at the negotiation and
00:31:32.039 negotiation table then of course United
00:31:34.440 States like the strongest partner of the
00:31:38.039 Ukraine and of course Europe I think
00:31:41.240 Europe is very important I want to speak
00:31:43.080 about it with the president yes Europe
00:31:45.559 is very important for us because we
00:31:47.639 really defend Europe for today all
00:31:49.760 Europeans are really recognized that we
00:31:53.039 are defending line and they have real
00:31:56.000 life and our people are dying that's why
00:31:58.200 they helped us and also it's about the
00:32:01.360 need yes between like the president said
00:32:04.279 you have big nice ocean yes between us
00:32:09.559 but if we will not stay Russia will go
00:32:12.360 further to baltics and to Poland by the
00:32:15.000 way but first to the baltics it's
00:32:17.240 understandable for them because they've
00:32:19.120 been they've been in the USSR you know
00:32:22.600 they they've been one of the republics
00:32:24.679 of the USSR and Putin wants to bring
00:32:27.159 them back to his Empire it's a fact and
00:32:30.159 when he will go there if we will not
00:32:31.919 stay you will fight your American
00:32:35.279 soldiers it doesn't matter do you have
00:32:37.919 Ocean or not your soldiers will fight Mr
00:32:41.480 President would you be willing to visit
00:32:42.799 Ukraine maybe K or Odessa which is known
00:32:45.120 to be a dir Le it was my question I'm
00:32:49.039 sorry I don't want to talk about Odessa
00:32:51.440 now let's not talk about Odessa I want
00:32:53.720 to talk about making a deal getting
00:32:56.360 peace we don't have to talk about o Desa
00:32:58.919 but a lot of cities have been destroyed
00:33:01.039 a lot of cities that are not
00:33:03.080 recognizable there's not a building
00:33:04.720 standing no no and a lot of come Mr you
00:33:08.200 have to come and to look no no no we
00:33:10.760 have very good cities yes a lot of
00:33:13.080 things been destroyed but mostly cities
00:33:16.399 alive and people work and children go to
00:33:19.600 school sometimes it's very difficult
00:33:21.559 sometimes closer to Front Line children
00:33:24.039 have to go to underground schools or
00:33:26.480 online but we live Ukraine is fighting
00:33:30.000 and Ukraine lives this is very important
00:33:33.039 and maybe it's Putin is sharing this
00:33:34.840 information that he destroyed us no he
00:33:38.039 lost
00:33:38.960 700,000 people 700,000 soldiers he lost
00:33:42.880 every SE
00:33:51.480 yes and what did he say that couple of
00:33:53.840 days ago and what what did he tell you
00:33:55.480 that gave you the assurance that he
00:33:56.799 wanted peace well that's what I do my
00:33:59.120 whole life is deals I know pretty good
00:34:01.960 uh and I really I've uh I've known him
00:34:05.080 for a long time I've dealt with him for
00:34:06.919 a long time he had to suffer through the
00:34:09.879 uh Russia hoax you know Russia Russia
00:34:11.800 Russia it was a hoax it was all Biden it
00:34:14.199 was nothing to do with him so he had to
00:34:16.399 suffer through that and he he was able
00:34:18.159 to do that uh I think that uh he wants
00:34:21.239 to make a deal and he like to see it end
00:34:24.440 it's all I do that's what I do my whole
00:34:26.239 life that's what I do is make deals
00:34:28.359 and I'm in the middle of a mess because
00:34:30.839 this is a real mess it's a very
00:34:33.119 dangerous one if this doesn't get solved
00:34:35.960 now it's not going to get solved for a
00:34:38.280 long time so I hope we're g to I hope
00:34:40.079 we're going to get it solv in the back
00:34:41.520 please thank you Mr President uh Prim
00:34:43.760 Minister Stormer Clint repeatedly that
00:34:45.599 his government believes in free speech
00:34:47.239 and was not engaged in censorship uh but
00:34:49.679 his country's government arrest people
00:34:51.440 for memes and thought crimes and even
00:34:53.560 more worrisome is pressuring uh American
00:34:56.280 companies to censor Americans on his
00:34:59.160 behalf um how can he be a reliable
00:35:01.680 trustworthy partner when he says things
00:35:03.359 that are demonstrably false on such an
00:35:05.520 important well we actually spoke to him
00:35:07.240 about that yesterday and we thought they
00:35:09.760 took it very very much too far JD was
00:35:13.160 very strong on it so was I so was Marco
00:35:17.079 and we've been speaking to him about it
00:35:18.599 Marco would you like to say something
00:35:20.040 about yeah we we we have concerns
00:35:21.760 obviously with the conduct of there
00:35:23.599 particularly as it impacts Americans and
00:35:25.720 there's real concern that American
00:35:27.160 speech would is online could fall into
00:35:29.440 the hands of British or any country's
00:35:31.240 jurisdiction and so this is a point the
00:35:33.400 vice president made at Munich and and I
00:35:35.280 think it's a very compelling one that
00:35:36.560 what unites us with Europe as much as
00:35:38.560 anything else is these shared values and
00:35:40.240 one of them being free speech and so if
00:35:42.680 Americans are threatened by it we're
00:35:44.680 going to need to take action in that
00:35:48.440 regard it's actually a very important
00:35:50.560 question we we spoke about this in
00:35:52.440 detail with the Prime Minister and the
00:35:53.960 foreign secretary and others at at lunch
00:35:55.720 yesterday and I know that secret
00:35:57.640 Secretary of Commerce lutnick followed
00:35:59.760 up in private meetings last night this
00:36:02.119 is really important we believe Americans
00:36:04.440 have the right to speak their mind even
00:36:06.240 if we in this room disagree with them
00:36:07.880 they have the right to speak their mind
00:36:09.599 in the Public Square which is often
00:36:11.359 online these days and we're going to
00:36:13.040 defend that right as it pertains to
00:36:14.920 American companies and American citizens
00:36:16.960 vigorously if we have to I do think that
00:36:19.280 under the president's leadership we're
00:36:20.560 going to find common ground with our
00:36:22.520 friends in the UK on this question but
00:36:24.680 it remains to be seen the principle that
00:36:26.800 will guide us is is we believe in free
00:36:29.040 speech in this country and we'll fight
00:36:30.680 for it for American citizens Mr deal is
00:36:34.000 there any other oil and gas components
00:36:36.119 deal is all a little bit we'll see but
00:36:39.560 we're not really looking for that so
00:36:40.839 much we got a lot we have more than
00:36:42.440 anybody in the world by far so no we're
00:36:45.240 not talking about it too much but a
00:36:46.560 little bit I think it it it affects also
00:36:49.079 but uh for the most part no and Sir is
00:36:52.280 there any uh agreement from uh Ukraine
00:36:54.680 to purchase uh us LNG part of the deal
00:36:59.119 the table no we don't need that I just
00:37:02.440 wanted to ask you about you just
00:37:04.040 mentioned that you'd spoken to Vladimir
00:37:05.640 Putin a couple of days ago just to be
00:37:07.040 clear that's a new call not the one that
00:37:09.920 I've spoken to him on numerous occasions
00:37:12.880 okay and how was the latest call what
00:37:14.920 did you
00:37:15.960 discuss how did it go are you serious
00:37:18.960 with that question I am I'd love to know
00:37:20.920 it went well I think I think we're going
00:37:23.280 to have a deal on the minerals deal Mr
00:37:25.280 President some of those minerals are in
00:37:26.599 the east of Ukraine not far from the
00:37:28.319 front lines and in areas that Russia has
00:37:30.480 occupied will you direct President Putin
00:37:33.000 to to withdraw his forces from those
00:37:34.720 areas if you're there's us well we'll
00:37:36.599 take a look at at the time we have a lot
00:37:38.480 of area uh it's a very big area we're
00:37:41.240 talking about so we'll take a look I'll
00:37:43.000 study that I'll see and who would
00:37:44.839 protect those minerals if if they are us
00:37:46.800 interest would that be Ukrainian they'll
00:37:48.640 be protected the agreement will protect
00:37:50.400 them the agreement yeah we're signing an
00:37:52.800 agreement what if Russia tries to invade
00:37:55.240 or or there's Russian aggression in
00:37:56.400 their spot I just told you I don't think
00:37:58.119 that's going to happen and if that were
00:37:59.640 going to happen I wouldn't make a deal
00:38:01.040 if I thought that was going to happen I
00:38:02.359 wouldn't make a deal some people may
00:38:04.200 wonder why you know they UT to focus on
00:38:05.800 CNN on Survival not asking me these
00:38:09.319 ridiculous
00:38:10.599 questions focus on Surviving because
00:38:13.000 CNN's got such low ratings I don't think
00:38:15.000 they're going to
00:38:16.359 survive let's
00:38:19.079 go already I already mentioned Poland uh
00:38:23.160 Poland was under Russian control for
00:38:26.200 decades after the second World War when
00:38:28.760 I was a kid I looked at the United
00:38:30.920 States not only as a most powerful
00:38:34.480 country richest country in the world the
00:38:36.960 country that has great music great
00:38:39.160 movies great muscle cars but also as a
00:38:42.560 Force for good do you and now I'm
00:38:46.160 talking with my friends in Poland and
00:38:47.960 they they are worried that you align
00:38:50.079 yourself too much with
00:38:51.880 Putin what's your message for
00:38:55.240 them well if I didn't align my myself
00:38:58.079 with both of them you'd never have a
00:39:00.319 deal you want me to say uh really
00:39:03.800 terrible things about Putin and then say
00:39:06.160 hi Vladimir how are we doing on the deal
00:39:08.000 that doesn't work that way I'm not
00:39:09.880 aligned with Putin I'm not aligned with
00:39:11.839 anybody I'm aligned with the United
00:39:13.520 States of America and for the good of
00:39:16.119 the world I'm aligned with the world and
00:39:18.839 I want to get this thing over with you
00:39:20.240 see the hatred he's got for Putin it's
00:39:22.319 very tough for me to make a deal with
00:39:24.000 that kind of he's got tremendous hatred
00:39:26.200 and I understand that but
00:39:27.880 I can tell you the other side isn't
00:39:29.440 exactly in love with you know him either
00:39:33.680 uh so it's not a question of alignment I
00:39:36.079 have to I'm aligned with the world I
00:39:38.760 want to get the things set i'm aligned
00:39:40.319 with
00:39:41.280 Europe I want to see if we can get this
00:39:43.760 thing done you want me to be tough I
00:39:46.480 could be tougher than any human being
00:39:48.079 you've ever seen I'd be so tough but you
00:39:51.079 never going to get a deal that way so
00:39:53.000 that's the way it goes all one more
00:39:55.599 questiony I would respond to this so
00:39:57.640 look for four years in the United States
00:39:59.640 of America we had a president who stood
00:40:01.640 up at press conferences and talked tough
00:40:03.720 about Vladimir Putin and then Putin
00:40:06.079 invaded Ukraine and destroyed a
00:40:08.119 significant chunk of the country the
00:40:10.119 path to peace and the path to Prosperity
00:40:13.160 is may be engaging in diplomacy we tried
00:40:17.000 the pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our
00:40:19.520 chest and pretending that the president
00:40:21.800 of the United States's words mattered
00:40:24.160 more than the president of the United
00:40:25.480 States's actions what makes makes
00:40:27.560 America a good country is America
00:40:29.400 engaging in diplomacy that's what
00:40:31.440 president Trump is doing can I ask you
00:40:34.440 sure yeah yeah okay so he occupied it uh
00:40:40.079 our parts big parts of Ukraine part of
00:40:43.079 East and Crimea uh so he occupied it on
00:40:48.480 2014
00:40:50.400 so during a lot of years I'm not
00:40:53.359 speaking about just Biden but those time
00:40:55.920 was Obama then President Obama then
00:40:58.880 president Trump then President Biden now
00:41:01.280 president Trump and God bless now
00:41:03.760 president Trump will stop him but during
00:41:06.000 2014 nobody stopped him he just occupied
00:41:09.160 and took he killed people you know what
00:41:11.599 the contact are
00:41:12.960 2015 2014 2014 and 2015 2014 yeah so I
00:41:17.680 was not here yeah that's exactly right
00:41:19.839 yes but during 2014 till
00:41:23.240 2022 yeah the what the situation the
00:41:26.119 same the people have been dying on the
00:41:28.880 contact line nobody stopped him you know
00:41:32.000 that we had conversations with him a lot
00:41:34.560 of conversation my bilateral
00:41:36.160 conversation and we signed with him me
00:41:39.400 like a new president in 2019 I signed
00:41:42.880 with him the deal I signed with him
00:41:46.119 macron and Merkel we signed ceasefire
00:41:49.839 ceasefire all of them told me that he
00:41:52.760 will never go we signed him guest
00:41:56.319 contract gas contract yes but after that
00:42:00.040 he broken this his fire he killed our
00:42:02.920 people and he didn't exchange prison we
00:42:05.880 signed the exchange of prison but he
00:42:08.079 didn't do it what kind of diplomacy JD
00:42:12.160 you are speaking about what what you
00:42:14.079 what you what do you mean I'm talking
00:42:15.920 about the kind of diplomacy that's going
00:42:17.400 to end the destruction of your country
00:42:19.119 yes but Mr President Mr President with
00:42:21.160 respect I think it's disrespectful for
00:42:22.920 you to come into the opal office and try
00:42:24.280 to litigate this in front of the
00:42:25.400 American Media right now you guys are
00:42:27.400 going around and forcing conscripts to
00:42:29.960 the front lines because you have
00:42:31.400 Manpower problems you should be thanking
00:42:33.680 the president for trying to bring it
00:42:35.240 into this conflict you ever been to
00:42:36.720 Ukraine that you say what problems we
00:42:38.680 have I have been to come on I've have

00:42:48.119 propaganda tour Mr President are do you
00:42:50.640 disagree that you've had problems
00:42:52.880 bringing people into your military and
00:42:54.880 do you think that it's respectful to
00:42:56.680 come to the Office of the United States
00:42:58.680 of America and attack the administration
00:43:00.680 that is trying to trying to prevent the
00:43:02.599 destruction of your country a lot of a
00:43:04.200 lot of questions let's start from the

00:45:15.400 equipment if you didn't have our
00:45:17.559 military equipment this war would have

00:45:35.920 that there are disagreements and let's
00:45:37.760 go litigate those disagreements rather

00:45:41.319 American Media when you're wrong we know
00:45:43.880 that you're wrong but you see I think
00:45:45.000 it's good for the American people to see

00:47:02.680 more question to vice president I'm
00:47:05.520 sorry going to be a tough deal to make
00:47:08.240 because the attitudes have to change
00:47:10.800 what if Russia breaks
00:47:15.160 this
00:47:19.119 do what are you saying she's asking what
00:47:22.319 if Russia breaks the ceasefire what if
00:47:25.000 they what if anything what if the bomb
00:47:27.200 drops on your head right now okay why
00:47:30.079 did they broke it I don't know they
00:47:32.000 broke it with Biden because Biden they
00:47:33.920 didn't respect him they didn't respect
00:47:35.760 Obama they respect
00:47:38.119 me let me tell you Putin went through a
00:47:40.440 hell of a lot with me he went through a
00:47:41.839 phony Witch Hunt where they used him and
00:47:44.800 Russia Russia Russia Russia you ever
00:47:47.280 hear of that deal that was a phony that
00:47:49.359 was a phony Hunter Biden Joe Biden scam
00:47:52.839 Hillary Clinton Shifty Adam Schiff it
00:47:55.720 was a Democrat scam and he had to go
00:47:58.960 through that and he did go through it we
00:48:01.040 didn't end up in a war and he went
00:48:03.520 through it he was accused of all that
00:48:05.000 stuff he had nothing to do with it it
00:48:06.720 came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom it
00:48:10.079 came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom it
00:48:13.119 was disgusting and then they said oh oh
00:48:17.040 the laptop from hell was made by Russia
00:48:20.640 the 51 agents the whole thing was a scam
00:48:24.040 and he had to put up with that he was
00:48:25.480 being accused of all that stuff
00:48:28.040 all I can say is this he might have
00:48:30.400 broken deals with Obama and Bush and he
00:48:33.520 might have broken him with Biden he did
00:48:35.760 maybe maybe he didn't I don't know what
00:48:37.400 happened but he didn't break him with me
00:48:39.800 he wants to make a deal I don't know if
00:48:41.359 you can make a deal the problem is I've
00:48:44.720 empowered you to be a tough guy and I
00:48:48.160 don't think you'd be a tough guy without
00:48:49.640 the United States and your people are
00:48:51.440 very brave but you're either going to
00:48:53.480 make a deal or we're out and if we're
00:48:55.799 out you'll fight it out I don't think
00:48:58.799 it's going to be pretty but you'll fight
00:49:00.760 it out but you don't have the cards but
00:49:03.839 once we sign that deal you're in a much
00:49:06.160 better position but you're not acting at
00:49:08.480 all thankful and that's not a nice thing
00:49:10.799 I'll be honest that's not a nice thing
