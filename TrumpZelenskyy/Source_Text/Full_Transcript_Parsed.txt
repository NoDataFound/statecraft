**President Trump:**  
Well, thank you very much. It’s an honor to have President Zalinski of Ukraine, and we’ve been working very hard, very close. So, we’ve actually known each other for a long time. We’ve been dealing with each other for a long time and very well. We had a little negotiation spat, but that worked out great, I think, for both countries. I think for the world, actually, beyond both countries. And we have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging, and working and getting some of the rare earth. But it means we’re going to be inside, and it’s a big commitment from the United States. And we appreciate working with you very much, and we will continue to do that. We have had some very good discussions with Russia. I spoke with President Putin, and we’re going to try and bring this to a close as something that you want and that he wants. We have to negotiate a deal, but we’ve started the confines of a deal, and I think something can happen. The big thing is the number of soldiers—mostly at this point—but soldiers being killed. You’re losing thousands of soldiers on both sides. We’re losing a lot of soldiers, and we want to see it stop, and we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use, like rebuilding, the rebuilding. And we’re going to be working very hard. But we’ve had a lot of very good conversations. I will say, until we came along, the Biden administration didn’t speak to Russia whatsoever. They didn’t speak to anybody. They just allowed this to continue. And I will say that—I’ll say in front of you, you’ve heard me say it a thousand times—if I were president, this war would have never happened. We would have had a deal negotiated for you without having to go through what you’ve gone through. But your soldiers have been unbelievably brave. We’ve given them great equipment, but somebody has to use the equipment. They’ve been unbelievably brave, and we give them great credit. This was supposed to be over very quickly, and here we are three years later. So, I give tremendous credit to your generals and your soldiers and yourself, in the sense that it’s been very hard fighting, very tough fighting. They’re great fighters, and you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint. But now we want to get it over with. It’s enough, right? We want to get it over with. So, it’s an honor to have you here. Thank you very much for coming. We’re going to sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little while, right after lunch. And we’ll be having lunch together. We’re also discussing some other things, and we appreciate everybody being here. It’s somewhat of an exciting moment, but the really exciting moment is when we get—when they stop the shooting, and we end up with the deal. And I think we’re fairly close to getting that. And an honor to have you. And please, would you like to say something?

**President Zelensky:**  
No, thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you for the invitation, and really, I hope that this document—first document—will be the first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine, our people, our children. I really count on it. And of course, we count that America will not stop support. Really, for us, it’s very important to support and to continue it. I want to discuss it in details further during our conversation, and of course, the infrastructure of security guarantees. Because for today, I understand what Europe is ready to do, and of course, I want to discuss with you what the United States will be ready to do. And I really count on your strong position to stop Putin. And you said that “enough with the war.” I think that is very important—to say these words to Putin at the very beginning, at the very beginning of the war, because he is a killer and terrorist. But I hope that together we can stop him. But for us, it’s very important to save our country, our values, our freedom, and democracy. And of course, no compromises with a killer about our territories—but it will be later. And of course, what I wanted—you know, we spoke about it by phone with you—about the drone production. We have very good drone production. I think the best one in the world for today because of the war, yes. And of course, we need very much the air defense. You have the best air defense in the world, and really, you helped us under attacks of Russians. And I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses. We’re open to share the licenses of all our drones with you, of course, with the United States. And we need licenses for quick production of air defense. Even after the war, we need our nation to be calm, that we are secured. So that’s why we need this air shield. And of course, about this, I want to speak about the coalition. I think that France and UK already spoke to you, and we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States, they will not be ready to be as strong as we need. And the last point—last, not least—about exchange, about our people and children. And you know that this crazy Russian—that they stole 20,000 Ukrainian children. They changed their names, they changed their families, relatives, and now they’re in Russia. We want to bring them back, and really, it’s a big, big dream, task, and goal for me. And our warriors—we, by the way, Mr.—we brought, we exchanged with—yes, it is more than 4,000 warriors from Russian prison. But there are thousands more in the prison. I wanted to share with you some images—how, how I’ve just—just can—can I now?

**President Trump:**  
Yeah, please. Some minute—one minute.

**President Zelensky:**  
One minute. I just want you to understand what—in what situation they are, and what the attitude of Russia to our prisoners—that guys—just you—before—before and after. And you see before and after. Just you to understand, now thousands of such guys, ladies, and men there. And so they don’t eat, they beat them, and they, you know—so they do a lot of bad things. So, out—even during the war, there are rules. Everybody knows there are rules during the war. These guys—they don’t have any rules. You see that—50, 60 kilos—and a lot of such things. And I didn’t want to show you what changes with images of children because—I will share, just share with you—I mean, it’s looking tragically.

**President Trump:**  
That’s tough stuff. Yeah.

**President Zelensky:**  
I wanted very much to give you—and you see, this is a pastor, by the way. They stole pastors because it’s not—Russian Church—they stole pastors and moved pastors to the prison. We, at the end of last year, we brought three pastors, and we could exchange them. This is a pastor—yes.

**President Trump:**  
Yeah, yeah.

**President Zelensky:**  
So, I mean, this—I wanted to show you. And this—thank you very much.

**President Trump:**  
We want to get that ended, right?

**President Zelensky:**  
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course we will.

**President Trump:**  
And I think we will. I think we will. And we have to. Of course. Do you have any questions?

**Reporter 1:**  
Please, thank you, Mr. President. With the—how much money is the US going to put into the fund that is being created today, and how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine?

**President Trump:**  
Well, we don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenue. So, it’s going to be a lot of money will be made from the sale and from the use of raw earth. And as you know, our country doesn’t have much raw earth. We have a lot of oil and gas, but we don’t have a lot of the raw earth. And what we do have is protected by the environmentalists, but that could be unprotected—but still, it’s not very much. They have—among the best in the world in terms of raw earth. So, we’re going to be using that—taking it, using it for all of the things we do, including AI and including weapons and the military. And it’s really going to very much satisfy our needs. So, it was something that just worked out really well. We have a lot of oil, and we have a lot of gas—we have a lot—but we don’t have raw earth. So, this has just about every component of the raw earth that we need for computers, for all of the things we do. This puts us in great shape. And the long-term security for—I think they’re going to have great—look, I think once we make the agreement, that’s going to be 95% of it. They’re not going to go back to fighting. I’ve spoken with President Putin, and I think—I mean, I feel very strong—I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they’re very serious about it, and we’ll make a deal. When the deal is made, I don’t think we talk about security. Everyone’s talking about—the other day, all they talked about was security. I said, “Let me make the deal first.” I have to make the deal first. I don’t worry about security right now. I have to—we have to have a deal because right now, last week, 2,000 soldiers died on both sides—2,000. And they’re losing a thousand, 2,000, 3,000 a week. So, as we sit here and we talk, people are getting shot and dying on the battlefield. And, you know, they’re not American soldiers, but they’re Russian soldiers and they’re Ukrainian soldiers. And we want to be able to stop it, and we want to be able also to spend money on other things. We don’t want to—this is a tremendous amount of money. And what the Biden administration did was terrible—they were giving money, but he had no security on the money. Europe, as you know, gave much less money, but they had security—it was in the form of a loan; they get their money back—and we didn’t. And now, at least we’re protected because the American taxpayer has to be protected too. But this is an incredible agreement for Ukraine because we have a big investment in their country now—and what they have, very few people have. And we’re able to really go forward with very, very high-tech things and many other things, including weaponry—weaponry that we’re going to use in many locations, but that we need for our country. This allows us to do this.

**President Zelensky:**  
Sorry, I’m sorry—yes, go ahead, please. I can just—yes, in the document, there is one of the very important points. If we speak about business and investment, we never had LNG terminals in Ukraine. This document will open—I mean, the next documents, but anyway, here we see in the framework—we see, we see really good will for this. Energy terminals for us is very important, and I think for security of the European continent. We have the biggest storage—gas storage—we have the biggest in Europe, yes.

**President Trump:**  
It’s yeah.

**President Zelensky:**  
And we can use it—you get for LNG—use it for LNG, and we will do it. And really, we can help Europe because Europe really helped—President Trump said that they made less support, but they have—our friends and they’re very supportive partners. They really gave a lot, Mr.—really, they did. They gave a lot, but they gave much less—no, much less—no.

**President Trump:**  
Okay.

**Reporter 2:**  
Mr. President Trump, you have repeatedly called the deal with Ukraine as a historical one, and as president of the United States, you make historical decisions in other issues which affect America and the world. So, what place in world history do you want to take, and do you associate yourself with any famous historical figures?

**President Trump:**  
Yeah, I’d say George Washington, Abraham Lincoln—I would say I’m far superior to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Now, you know I’m only kidding, right? Because when I say that, the fake news is going to go wild. They’re going to say, “He considers himself to be better than Washington.” But you never know, you never know. I don’t compare myself to anybody. I just—I’m here to do a job. We’ve had a great 35 days or whatever it might be—a month, a little more than a month. We’ve accomplished tremendous amounts—not only this. This would be a very great achievement if we could get this—the war stopped—and get them back to normalization. I think that’s going to happen. We’ve had very good talks on both sides, as you know. But I think we’ve done a very good job just generally. If you look at all of the things we’ve done in 30 days, they’re saying there’s never been an opening for a president—the first month—there’s never been a first month like we’ve had. And this is one of the very important things. This, to me, is one of the most important things because we have tremendous death taking place as we speak, and I don’t want to have that. You know, think of the parents—think of the—whether they’re in Russia or Ukraine—think of the parents of all these people being killed needlessly. They came to—war should have never started. This would have never started if I were president.

**Reporter 3:**  
Will you continue sending military aid to Ukraine after you—the US signs this agreement with Ukraine? Question to President Zelensky—do you feel like the US is on your side, that President Trump is on your side at this moment?

**President Trump:**  
What do you think? He wants to know—do you think that—sort of a stupid question, I guess. I guess we wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.

**President Zelensky:**  
I think that—I think that the United States on our side from the very beginning of occupation. And I think that President Trump on our side, and—not—I’m sure that United States President will not stop support. This is crucial for us. It’s important for us, yes. And Putin—President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying, but they came to our territory. They came to our land. They began this war, and they have to stop. And I think all this is the question with—really, the most important question—can President Trump—I hope, yes—with some other allies, to stop Putin, withdraw these enemies—our enemies—withdraw these troops from our land. And I think that—you asked about the history—about the—I think that if President—or when he will stop Putin—if President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be on this wall.

**President Trump:**  
We’ve had very, very good talks.

**Reporter 4:**  
UK—President Zelensky just said that there’d be no compromises with Vladimir Putin. I just wanted to ask both of you—firstly, are there compromises that you think that President Zelensky is going to have to make? And President Zelensky—is there anything that you might be thinking you may be able to offer or bring to the table—for example, elections?

**President Trump:**  
Thank you. I think you’re going to have to always make compromises. You can’t do any deals without compromises. So, certainly, he’s going to have to make some compromises—but hopefully they won’t be as big as some people think you’re going to have to make. That’s all—that’s all we can do. I’m here as an arbitrator, as a mediator to a certain extent, between two parties that have been very hostile—to put it mildly. They’ve been very hostile. There has been a vicious war—this has been a vicious war. You know, it’s a very level battlefield, and those bullets go out, and as I’ve said many times—we’re talking about it with people many times—the only thing stopping those bullets is a human body. And in the case we’re talking about, generally, young human bodies are stopping a lot of bullets. It’s dead level—that’s why it’s great farmland. It’s great land—it’s great farmland—but there’s very little protection against the bullets that are being—and other things that are being shot. So, all I can do is see if I can get everybody at the table and get an agreement. And I think we’re going to end up with an agreement—otherwise, I wouldn’t probably be even here today.

**Reporter 5:**  
Mr. President, I’ve got two questions for you. You think, ultimately, your legacy will be “The Peacemaker” and not the president that led this country into another war and ended foreign wars? And then I’ve got a question—

**President Trump:**  
I hope it will. I mean, I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker. This is—this would be a great thing if we could do this. I’m doing this to save lives more than anything else—second is to save a lot of money, but I consider that to be far less important. So, I hope I’m going to—thank you, Brian, for that question. It was a nice question. I hope I’ll be known and recognized as a peacemaker. This would be a great thing to solve. This is a very dangerous situation—you know, this could lead to a third world war. This was headed in the wrong direction. If this election were lost—if we didn’t win this election—and by “we,” we won it by a lot. That was a mandate. We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. We won everything—the districts. You look at the areas of red—take a look at a map—this was a big mandate. And this was one of the things I said—we’re going to get this thing settled. If we didn’t win, I think this would have—this could have very well ended up in a third world war, and that would not—that would not have been a good situation. What was your second question?

**Reporter 5:**  
My second question—for President Zelensky—now, do you ever—why don’t you wear a suit? You’re the highest—why don’t you wear a suit? You’re the highest level in this country’s office, and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit—yeah, you have problems. I—a lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.

**President Zelensky:**  
I will wear a costume after this war will finish, okay? Yes, maybe one—maybe something—maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better—I don’t know. We will see—maybe something cheaper than—yeah.

**President Trump:**  
Thank you, thank you.

**Reporter 6:**  
Thank you, President Trump. You said yesterday—are you going to send more arms to Ukraine in case there’s no peace?

**President Trump:**  
Yeah, we’re going to have arms to Ukraine—yeah, here. Hopefully, I won’t have to send very much because hopefully we’re going to have it finished. We’re looking forward to finishing this quickly. We’re not looking forward to sending a lot of arms—we’re looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things. But we very much appreciate the agreement because we needed what they had, and we’re treating—you know, our country is now treated fairly. Biden didn’t do that—Biden—he didn’t know what the hell he was doing. This should have never happened—this should have never started. But, you know, sure, the answer is yes—but hopefully we won’t have to send much because I’m looking forward to getting it done—getting it done quickly, very quickly.

**Reporter 6:**  
Does that provide security guarantees, Mr. President?

**President Trump:**  
I don’t want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done. You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody else—a million times you said it over and over—I want to get the deal done. Security is so easy—that’s about 2% of the problem. I’m not worried about security—I’m worried about getting the deal done. The security is the easy part—security is very nice. Everybody stops shooting, and now—will Europe put people there? I know France is going to—I know the UK is going to—I know other countries are going to, and they happen to be right next door. We haven’t committed, but we could conceivably—you know, we have security in a different form. We’ll have workers there—digging, digging, digging—taking the raw earth so that we can create a lot of great product in this country. So, in that sense, you have something—but we haven’t determined that yet. I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to—and they were here, as you know, last week and just the other day—they have committed to a lot of security. I don’t think you’re going to need much security—I think once this deal gets done, it’s over. Russia is not going to want to go back, and nobody’s going to want to go back. When this—when this deal ends, I really believe this deal is going to be over.

**Reporter 7:**  
Question—yeah, please, go ahead, Mr. President. Thank you. You had Macron and Keir Starmer at the White House this past week—both of whom praised your courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace. Part of that involved, though, re-engaging Russia in diplomatic relations—something that previous leaders lacked the conviction to do. So, what gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead that?

**President Trump:**  
Well, I love this guy—who are you with?

**Reporter 7:**  
American News, sir.

**President Trump:**  
Well, that’s why I like him—American News does a great job. That’s very—I like the question—I think it’s a very good question. It is—it’s a pathway to peace. It’s a pathway to getting something solved, and I feel that as the head of this country, I have an obligation to do that. Plus, you know, we’re very much involved—we got involved. It’s too bad we got involved because there should have been no involvement because there should have been no war. And there shouldn’t have been October 7th—that would have never happened. As you know, Iran was broke—they had no money to give to Hezbollah; they had no money to give to Hamas. They were stone-cold broke. And then, under Biden, they became rich as hell—they went from no money to 300 billion dollars in a period of four years, and they gave a lot of that money away, and you see what happened. And that’s a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve. But no, I appreciate your question very much. I just—I feel I have an obligation to try and do something to stop the death. I can’t—

**President Zelensky:**  
Yes, if I can answer—sorry, please—please. And I do like your clothing, brother—yeah, really—even though I have to—I think he’s a great guy, by the way. But I don’t know if you two like each other, but you know what—I think he’s—I think I like this guy. I don’t—I think he’s dressed beautiful.

**President Trump:**  
I have more serious things than—

**President Zelensky:**  
Answer on such question—I will answer on more serious question, if I can—yeah. So, please—about security guarantees and about just ceasefire. We can’t just speak about this ceasefire and speak and speak—it will not work. Just ceasefire will not—never work—because I’m, like, a president—I have this experience, and not only me—Ukraine, before my presidency—from 2014, Putin broken 25 times—25 times—he broken his own signature—25 times he broken ceasefire. It—he never broke to me—he never broke—no, no, you were the president—he—the president during 2016—you’ve been the president—

**President Trump:**  
Mr.—Mr. President, you’ve been the president, but—

**President Zelensky:**  
He—for—he had—of course, not with you—but he had—during those periods, he had conversations with our side, and we had Normandy format—you know, the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia—and he broken 25 times. That’s why we will never accept just ceasefire—it will not work—without security guarantees. Security guarantees—maybe President is right about this document and other—but this document is not enough. Strong army is enough—because his soldiers afraid—Putin soldiers afraid of our soldiers when we’re strong enough. If we are not strong enough—if we are empty—if our storage is empty—we can’t defend our land today. You know—he knows that we have—all the world knows that we have—meeting—yes. Why he’s using ballistic—Putin today using ballistic on our hospitals, schools, and etc.—ballistic—so he knows that we are here and that President Trump is really have good will to stop—to stop this war. And I—and you hear now the President—so why he’s using—so he doesn’t want to stop—he doesn’t want—but I hope that we will do it—really, we’ll do it—security. When we speak about security guarantees—when the Europeans are ready for contingents—they need USA backstop. If there will not be United States, we will not—never have any continent—strong contingents from the Europeans—because they don’t want to divide airlines connection between the United States and the main and strongest—and Europeans—and this is crucial—this is important—that what we want to speak about very much—this is very important—and there are defense—so air defense—really, we have big deficit with all these systems, and we need to provide this—we need it very much—otherwise Putin will never stop and go further and further. He doesn’t want—he hate us, you know—it’s not about me—he hate Ukrainians—he thinks that we are not a nation. He thinks—and he shared—I think maybe with your team also—I don’t know—but with all the Europeans, in media, officially and not—he always said that we—there is no such country, such nation, such language, and such life like Ukrainian—no—he really doesn’t respect all the Ukrainians, and he wants destroy us—we—and you are right, Mr. President—that’s 2%—this document—maybe other documents—it’s a very good start—very good—but it will not enough to stop this person—this is rule of the war—this is the rule of the war during all the centuries—all the history—this is the rule of the war—who began—those pay. This is the rule—Putin began this war—he has to pay all money for renovation—he has to pay—of course, some Russian assets—what we have in Europe—about 300 billions—we can use them—we can use for renovation and buy military support from the United States also—we can do it—but it’s not enough—it’s—

**Reporter 8:**  
Circumstances—do you envision the trilateral—wait, one second—I want—I ask this question that you didn’t like because I wanted to know if you want to position yourself in the middle—between Russia and Ukraine—or on the Ukraine side?

**President Trump:**  
No, I’m in the middle—I want to solve this thing. I’m for—up for both—I want to get it solved. And it’s wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved. If we can solve it—great. If we can’t solve it, they’re going to have to fight it out, and who knows what’s going to happen—but I want to see it get solved.

**Reporter 9:**  
May I follow up—one more question—about US troops in Europe. After Russian invasion of Ukraine, your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe, including Poland—my country. Are you committed to keeping these troops on the eastern flank of NATO in the future?

**President Trump:**  
I’m very committed to Poland—I think Poland is really stepped up and done a great job for NATO. They, as you know—they paid more than they had to—they are one of the finest groups of people I’ve ever known. I’m very committed to Poland. What about Baltics?

**Reporter 9:**  
Poland’s in a tough neighborhood—you know—what about Baltics?

**President Trump:**  
The Baltics—they got a lot of—it’s a tough neighborhood too—but we’re committed. We’re going to be very committed, and we’re committed to NATO—but NATO has to step up, and the Europeans have to step up more than they have. And I want to see them equalize—because they are in for far less than we’re in, and they should be at least equal. You understand that—why is the United States—we have an ocean in between—why is the United States in for so much more money and other things as Europe? With that being said, as you said, they’ve also been obviously very helpful—but we have put in far more than they have, and I think they should equalize.

**Reporter 10:**  
Mr. President, please go ahead—about the agreement again today—what changed between the first time that Secretary Vess gave President Zelensky the agreement and today for the signing?

**President Trump:**  
What we made—a deal. So, I’m—I’m a business person—we made a deal. That’s what changed. I didn’t think we were going to make a deal, and we ended up making the deal—so that changed.

**Reporter 11:**  
Mr. President—what—and how do you envision a trilateral summit with President Zelensky and—

**President Trump:**  
I don’t know—but—well, they don’t like each other—I can tell you that—they do not like each other—said this is not a love match—and it’s unfortunate—that’s why you’re in this situation. The United States should not have allowed this to happen—okay—the United States—run by a man that didn’t know much—I’m going to be very nice—run by an incompetent person—very incompetent person—should never have allowed this to happen. I’ve stopped wars—I’ve stopped many wars—my people will tell you—I stopped wars that nobody ever heard of about—I stopped wars before they ever started. You can look at some of—some of—I could give you a lot of nations that would tell you right now—they were probably going to war—I could tell you right now there’s a nation thinking about going to war on something that nobody in this room has ever even heard of—two smaller nations—but big—still big—and I think I’ve stopped it—but this should have never happened—

**President Zelensky:**  
About—sorry—just a second—about any negotiations—that—first of all, I want—I want really to tell you—and I think that everybody understand—that Ukraine—more than Ukrainians—nobody want to stop this war—but at the future—any negotiations—it’s understandable that two sides of the war—not Russia and the United States—because this is not the war between Russia and the United States—this is war of Russia against Ukraine and Ukrainian people—so these two sides will—will be at the—any—anyway—will be at the negotiation—and negotiation table—then, of course, United States—like the strongest partner of the Ukraine—and of course Europe—I think Europe is very important—I want to speak about it with the President—yes—Europe is very important for us because we really defend Europe—for today—all Europeans are really recognized that we are defending line—and they have real life—and our people are dying—that’s why they helped us—and also it’s about the need—yes—between—like the President said—you have big, nice ocean—yes—between us—but if we will not stay—Russia will go further—to Baltics—and to Poland, by the way—but first to the Baltics—it’s understandable for them—because they’ve been—they’ve been in the USSR—you know—they’ve been one of the republics of the USSR—and Putin wants to bring them back to his empire—it’s a fact—and when he will go there—if we will not stay—you will fight—your American soldiers—it doesn’t matter—do you have ocean or not—your soldiers will fight—

**Reporter 12:**  
Mr. President—would you be willing to visit Ukraine—maybe Kyiv or Odessa—which is known to be a—

**President Trump:**  
It was my question—I’m sorry—I don’t want to talk about Odessa now—let’s not talk about Odessa—I want to talk about making a deal—getting peace—we don’t have to talk about Odessa—but a lot of cities have been destroyed—a lot of cities that are not recognizable—there’s not a building standing—

**President Zelensky:**  
No, no—and a lot of—no—Mr.—you have to come and to look—no, no, no—we have very good cities—yes—a lot of things been destroyed—but mostly—cities alive—and people work—and children go to school—sometimes it’s very difficult—sometimes closer to frontline—children have to go to underground schools—or online—but we live—Ukraine is fighting—and Ukraine lives—this is very important—and maybe it’s—Putin is sharing this information that he destroyed us—no—he lost—700,000 people—700,000 soldiers—he lost—every—

**President Trump:**  
Yes—and what did he say that—a couple of days ago—and what—what did he tell you that gave you the assurance that he wanted peace?

**President Trump:**  
Well, that’s what I do my whole life is deals—I know pretty good—and I really—I’ve—I’ve known him for a long time—I’ve dealt with him for a long time—he had to suffer through the Russia hoax—you know—Russia, Russia, Russia—it was a hoax—it was all Biden—it was nothing to do with him—so he had to suffer through that—and he—he was able to do that—I think that—he wants to make a deal—and he’d like to see it end—it’s all I do—that’s what I do my whole life—that’s what I do is make deals—and I’m in the middle of a mess because this is a real mess—it’s a very dangerous one—if this doesn’t get solved now—it’s not going to get solved for a long time—so I hope we’re going to—I hope we’re going to get it solved—

**Reporter 13:**  
In the back—please—thank you, Mr. President—Prime Minister Starmer claimed repeatedly that his government believes in free speech and was not engaged in censorship—but his country’s government arrests people for memes and thought crimes—and even more worrisome is pressuring American companies to censor Americans on his behalf—how can he be a reliable, trustworthy partner when he says things that are demonstrably false on such an important—

**President Trump:**  
Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday—and we thought they took it very, very much too far—JD was very strong on it—so was I—so was Marco—and we’ve been speaking to him about it—Marco, would you like to say something about—

**Marco:**  
Yeah—we—we have concerns—obviously—with the conduct of there—particularly as it impacts Americans—and there’s real concern that American speech online could fall into the hands of British—or any country’s—jurisdiction—and so this is a point the Vice President made at Munich—and I think it’s a very compelling one—that what unites us with Europe as much as anything else is these shared values—and one of them being free speech—and so if Americans are threatened by it—we’re going to need to take action in that regard—it’s actually a very important question—we spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday—and I know that Secretary of Commerce Lutnick followed up in private meetings last night—this is really important—we believe Americans have the right to speak their mind—even if we in this room disagree with them—they have the right to speak their mind in the public square—which is often online these days—and we’re going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to—I do think that under the President’s leadership—we’re going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question—but it remains to be seen—the principle that will guide us is—we believe in free speech in this country—and we’ll fight for it for American citizens—

**President Trump:**  
Mr.—deal—is there any other oil and gas components—

**Reporter 14:**  
Deal is all—a little bit—

**President Trump:**  
We’ll see—but we’re not really looking for that so much—we got a lot—we have more than anybody in the world by far—so no—we’re not talking about it too much—but a little bit—I think it—it affects also—but for the most part—no—

**Reporter 15:**  
And sir—is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase US LNG—part of the deal—the table—

**President Trump:**  
No—we don’t need that—

**Reporter 16:**  
I just wanted to ask you about—you just mentioned that you’d spoken to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago—just to be clear—that’s a new call—not the one that—

**President Trump:**  
I’ve spoken to him on numerous occasions—okay—and how was the latest call—what did you discuss—how did it go—are you serious with that question—

**Reporter 16:**  
I am—I’d love to know—

**President Trump:**  
It went well—I think—I think we’re going to have a deal—

**Reporter 17:**  
On the minerals deal—Mr. President—some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine—not far from the frontlines—and in areas that Russia has occupied—will you direct President Putin to withdraw his forces from those areas if you’re—there’s US—

**President Trump:**  
Well, we’ll take a look at—at the time—we have a lot of area—it’s a very big area we’re talking about—so we’ll take a look—I’ll study that—I’ll see—and who would protect those minerals—if they are US interest—would that be Ukrainian—

**President Trump:**  
They’ll be protected—the agreement will protect them—the agreement—yeah—we’re signing an agreement—

**Reporter 17:**  
What if Russia tries to invade—or there’s Russian aggression in their spot—

**President Trump:**  
I just told you—I don’t think that’s going to happen—and if that were going to happen—I wouldn’t make a deal—if I thought that was going to happen—I wouldn’t make a deal—some people may wonder why—you know—they used to focus on CNN—on survival—not asking me these ridiculous questions—focus on surviving—because CNN’s got such low ratings—I don’t think they’re going to survive—let’s go—already—

**Reporter 18:**  
I already mentioned Poland—Poland was under Russian control for decades after the Second World War—when I was a kid—I looked at the United States not only as the most powerful country—richest country in the world—the country that has great music—great movies—great muscle cars—but also as a force for good—do you—and now I’m talking with my friends in Poland—and they—they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin—what’s your message for them—

**President Trump:**  
Well, if I didn’t align myself with both of them—you’d never have a deal—you want me to say really terrible things about Putin—and then say, “Hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal?”—that doesn’t work that way—I’m not aligned with Putin—I’m not aligned with anybody—I’m aligned with the United States of America—and for the good of the world—I’m aligned with the world—and I want to get this thing over with—you see the hatred he’s got for Putin—it’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of—he’s got tremendous hatred—and I understand that—but I can tell you—the other side isn’t exactly in love with—you know—him either—so it’s not a question of alignment—I have to—I’m aligned with the world—I want to get the things settled—I’m aligned with Europe—I want to see if we can get this thing done—you want me to be tough—I could be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen—I’d be so tough—but you’re never going to get a deal that way—so that’s the way it goes—all—

**JD (Vice President):**  
One more question—I would respond to this—so look—for four years in the United States of America—we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin—and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country—the path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy—we tried the pathway of Joe Biden—of thumping our chest and pretending that the President of the United States’s words mattered more than the President of the United States’s actions—what makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy—that’s what President Trump is doing—

**President Zelensky:**  
Can I ask you—sure—yeah—yeah—okay—so he occupied—our parts—big parts of Ukraine—parts of east and Crimea—so he occupied it on 2014—so during a lot of years—I’m not speaking about just Biden—but those time was Obama—then President Obama—then President Trump—then President Biden—now President Trump—and God bless—now President Trump will stop him—but during 2014—nobody stopped him—he just occupied—and took—he killed people—you know—what the contact are—2015—2014—2014 and 2015—2014—yeah—

**President Trump:**  
So I was not here—yeah—that’s exactly right—yes—

**President Zelensky:**  
But during 2014 till 2022—yeah—the—what—the situation—the same—the people have been dying on the contact line—nobody stopped him—you know that—we had conversations with him—a lot of conversation—my bilateral conversation—and we signed with him—me—like a new president in 2019—I signed with him the deal—I signed with him—Macron and Merkel—we signed ceasefire—ceasefire—all of them told me that he will never go—we signed him—gas contract—gas contract—yes—but after that—he broken this ceasefire—he killed our people—and he didn’t exchange prison—we signed the exchange of prison—but he didn’t do it—what kind of diplomacy—JD—you are speaking about—what—what you—what you—what do you mean—

**JD (Vice President):**  
I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country—yes—but Mr. President—Mr. President—with respect—I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now—you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the frontlines because you have manpower problems—you should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict—you ever been to Ukraine—that you say what problems we have—

**President Zelensky:**  
I have been to—come on—I’ve have actually—I’ve actually watched and seen the stories—and I know what happens is—you bring people—you bring them on a propaganda tour—

**JD (Vice President):**  
Mr. President—are—do you disagree that you’ve had problems bringing people into your military—and do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to—trying to prevent the destruction of your country—

**President Zelensky:**  
A lot of—a lot of questions—let’s start from the beginning—first of all—during the war—everybody has problems—even you—but you have nice ocean and don’t feel now—but you will feel it in the future—God bless—you don’t know that—God bless—God bless—you will not have war—don’t tell us what we’re going to feel—we’re trying to solve a problem—don’t tell us what we’re going to feel—

**JD (Vice President):**  
I’m not telling you—

**President Trump:**  
You’re in no position to dictate that—you’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel—we’re going to feel very good—we’re going to feel very good and very strong—you will feel influence—you’re right now not in a very good position—you’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position—and he happens to be right about—from the very beginning of the war—you’re not in a good position—you don’t have the cards right now—with us—you start having cards right now—you don’t—you’re playing cards—you’re gambling with the lives of millions of people—you’re gambling with World War—you’re gambling with World War III—and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country—this country—that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have—have you said thank you once this entire meeting—no—in this entire meeting—have you said thank you—you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October—offer some words of appreciation for United States of America and the President who’s trying to save your country—please—

**President Zelensky:**  
You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war—you—

**President Trump:**  
He’s not speaking loudly—he’s not speaking loudly—your country is in big trouble—

**President Zelensky:**  
Can I—no, no—you’ve done a lot of talking—your country is in big trouble—I know—you’re not winning—you’re not winning this—I—

**President Trump:**  
You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us—

**President Zelensky:**  
Mr. President—we are staying in our country—staying strong—from the very beginning of the war—we’ve been alone—and we are thankful—I said thanks—this cabinet—in this cab—we gave you—through this stupid President—$350 billion—we gave you military equipment—and you men are brave—but they had to use our military—if you didn’t have our military equipment—if you didn’t have our military equipment—this war would have been over in two weeks—in three days—I heard it from Putin—in three days—this is something—in two weeks—of course—yes—it’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this—tell—just say thank you—except American people—except that there are disagreements—and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media—when you’re wrong—we know that you’re wrong—but you see—I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on—understand—I think it’s very important—that’s why I kept this going so long—you have to be thankful—you don’t have the cards—you’re buried there—you’re—your people are dying—you’re running low on soldiers—listen—you’re running low on soldiers—it would be a damn good thing—and then you—then you tell us—I don’t want to ceasefire—I don’t want to ceasefire—I want to go—and I want this—I look—if you could get a ceasefire right now—I tell you—you take it—so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed—

**President Zelensky:**  
Of course—of course we want to stop the war—but I—you’re saying—you don’t want to ceasefire—

**President Trump:**  
Said to you—I want a ceasefire—guarantees—because you’ll get a ceasefire faster than it—agree—ask—how—people—about ceasefire—what they think—that wasn’t—that wasn’t with me—that was with a—a guy named Biden—who was not a smart person—that was—that was with Obama—

**President Zelensky:**  
It was your—excuse me—that was with Obama—who gave you sheets—and I gave you Javelins—yes—I gave you the Javelins—to take out all those tanks—Obama gave you sheets—in fact, the statement is—Obama gave sheets and Trump gave Javelins—you got to be more thankful—because—let me tell you—you don’t have the cards—with us—you have the cards—but without us—you don’t have any cards—

**Reporter 19:**  
One more question—to Vice President—I’m sorry—going to be a tough deal to make—because the attitudes have to change—what if Russia breaks this—

**JD (Vice President):**  
Do—what are you saying—

**Reporter 19:**  
She’s asking—what if Russia breaks the ceasefire—what if they—what if anything—what if the bomb drops on your head right now—okay—

**President Trump:**  
Why did they break it—I don’t know—they broke it with Biden—because Biden—they didn’t respect him—they didn’t respect Obama—they respect me—let me tell you—Putin went through a hell of a lot with me—he went through a phony witch hunt—where they used him—and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia—you ever hear of that deal—that was a phony—that was a phony Hunter Biden—Joe Biden scam—Hillary Clinton—Shifty Adam Schiff—it was a Democrat scam—and he had to go through that—and he did go through it—we didn’t end up in a war—and he went through it—he was accused of all that stuff—he had nothing to do with it—it came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom—it came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom—it was disgusting—and then they said—oh, oh—the laptop from hell was made by Russia—the 51 agents—the whole thing was a scam—and he had to put up with that—he was being accused of all that stuff—all I can say is this—he might have broken deals with Obama and Bush—and he might have broken them with Biden—he did—maybe—maybe he didn’t—I don’t know what happened—but he didn’t break them with me—he wants to make a deal—I don’t know if you can make a deal—the problem is—I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy—and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States—and your people are very brave—but you’re either going to make a deal—or we’re out—and if we’re out—you’ll fight it out—I don’t think it’s going to be pretty—but you’ll fight it out—but you don’t have the cards—but once we sign that deal—you’re in a much better position—but you’re not acting at all thankful—and that’s not a nice thing—I’ll be honest—that’s not a nice thing—all right—I think we’ve seen enough—what do you think—huh—this is—this is going to be great television—I will say that—all right—we’ll see what we can do about—put this is—we’ll see—guys—come on—
